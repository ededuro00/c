It truth universally acknowledged, single man possession
good fortune, must want wife.

However little known feelings views man may
first entering neighbourhood, truth well fixed minds
surrounding families, considered rightful property
one daughters.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said lady one day, "have heard
Netherfield Park let last?"

Mr. Bennet replied not.

"But is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long here,
told it."

Mr. Bennet made answer.

"Do want know taken it?" cried wife impatiently.

"_You_ want tell me, I objection hearing it."

This invitation enough.

"Why, dear, must know, Mrs. Long says Netherfield taken
young man large fortune north England; came
Monday chaise four see place, much
delighted it, agreed Mr. Morris immediately;
take possession Michaelmas, servants
house end next week."

"What name?"

"Bingley."

"Is married single?"

"Oh! Single, dear, sure! A single man large fortune; four
five thousand year. What fine thing girls!"

"How so? How affect them?"

"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied wife, "how tiresome! You
must know I thinking marrying one them."

"Is design settling here?"

"Design! Nonsense, talk so! But likely
_may_ fall love one them, therefore must visit
soon comes."

"I see occasion that. You girls may go, may send
themselves, perhaps still better,
handsome them, Mr. Bingley may like best
party."

"My dear, flatter me. I certainly _have_ share beauty,
I pretend anything extraordinary now. When woman five
grown-up daughters, ought give thinking beauty."

"In cases, woman often much beauty think of."

"But, dear, must indeed go see Mr. Bingley comes
neighbourhood."

"It I engage for, I assure you."

"But consider daughters. Only think establishment would
one them. Sir William Lady Lucas determined
go, merely account, general, know, visit
newcomers. Indeed must go, impossible _us_
visit not."

"You over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley
glad see you; I send lines assure
hearty consent marrying whichever chooses girls; though
I must throw good word little Lizzy."

"I desire thing. Lizzy bit better
others; I sure half handsome Jane, half
good-humoured Lydia. But always giving _her_ preference."

"They none much recommend them," replied he; "they
silly ignorant like girls; Lizzy something
quickness sisters."

"Mr. Bennet, _can_ abuse children way? You
take delight vexing me. You compassion poor nerves."

"You mistake me, dear. I high respect nerves. They
old friends. I heard mention consideration
last twenty years least."

"Ah, know I suffer."

"But I hope get it, live see many young men four
thousand year come neighbourhood."

"It use us, twenty come, since
visit them."

"Depend upon it, dear, twenty, I visit
all."

Mr. Bennet odd mixture quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, caprice, experience three-and-twenty years
insufficient make wife understand character. _Her_ mind
less difficult develop. She woman mean understanding,
little information, uncertain temper. When discontented,
fancied nervous. The business life get
daughters married; solace visiting news.



Chapter 2


Mr. Bennet among earliest waited Mr. Bingley. He
always intended visit him, though last always assuring
wife go; till evening visit
paid knowledge it. It disclosed following
manner. Observing second daughter employed trimming hat,
suddenly addressed with:

"I hope Mr. Bingley like it, Lizzy."

"We way know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes," said mother
resentfully, "since visit."

"But forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that shall meet
assemblies, Mrs. Long promised introduce him."

"I believe Mrs. Long thing. She two nieces
own. She selfish, hypocritical woman, I opinion
her."

"No I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I glad find
depend serving you."

Mrs. Bennet deigned make reply, but, unable contain
herself, began scolding one daughters.

"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, Heaven's sake! Have little
compassion nerves. You tear pieces."

"Kitty discretion coughs," said father; "she times
ill."

"I cough amusement," replied Kitty fretfully. "When
next ball be, Lizzy?"

"To-morrow fortnight."

"Aye, is," cried mother, "and Mrs. Long come back
till day before; impossible introduce him,
know herself."

"Then, dear, may advantage friend, introduce
Mr. Bingley _her_."

"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, I acquainted
myself; teasing?"

"I honour circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance certainly
little. One cannot know man really end
fortnight. But _we_ venture somebody else will; all,
Mrs. Long neices must stand chance; and, therefore,
think act kindness, decline office, I
take myself."

The girls stared father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense,
nonsense!"

"What meaning emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do
consider forms introduction, stress laid
them, nonsense? I cannot quite agree _there_. What say you,
Mary? For young lady deep reflection, I know, read
great books make extracts."

Mary wished say something sensible, knew how.

"While Mary adjusting ideas," continued, "let us return Mr.
Bingley."

"I sick Mr. Bingley," cried wife.

"I sorry hear _that_; tell before? If
I known much morning I certainly would called
him. It unlucky; I actually paid visit,
cannot escape acquaintance now."

The astonishment ladies wished; Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing rest; though, first tumult joy
over, began declare expected
while.

"How good you, dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I
persuade last. I sure loved girls well
neglect acquaintance. Well, pleased I am!
good joke, too, gone morning never said
word till now."

"Now, Kitty, may cough much choose," said Mr. Bennet; and,
spoke, left room, fatigued raptures wife.

"What excellent father have, girls!" said she, door
shut. "I know ever make amends kindness;
me, either, matter. At time life
pleasant, I tell you, making new acquaintances every day;
sakes, would anything. Lydia, love, though _are_
youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley dance next
ball."

"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I afraid; though I _am_
youngest, I'm tallest."

The rest evening spent conjecturing soon would
return Mr. Bennet's visit, determining ask
dinner.



Chapter 3


Not Mrs. Bennet, however, assistance five
daughters, could ask subject, sufficient draw
husband satisfactory description Mr. Bingley. They attacked
various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions,
distant surmises; eluded skill all,
last obliged accept second-hand intelligence neighbour,
Lady Lucas. Her report highly favourable. Sir William
delighted him. He quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, crown whole, meant next assembly
large party. Nothing could delightful! To fond
dancing certain step towards falling love; lively
hopes Mr. Bingley's heart entertained.

"If I see one daughters happily settled Netherfield,"
said Mrs. Bennet husband, "and others equally well
married, I shall nothing wish for."

In days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, sat
ten minutes library. He entertained hopes
admitted sight young ladies, whose beauty
heard much; saw father. The ladies somewhat
fortunate, advantage ascertaining upper
window wore blue coat, rode black horse.

An invitation dinner soon afterwards dispatched; already
Mrs. Bennet planned courses credit
housekeeping, answer arrived deferred all. Mr. Bingley
obliged town following day, and, consequently, unable
accept honour invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet quite
disconcerted. She could imagine business could town
soon arrival Hertfordshire; began fear
might always flying one place another, never
settled Netherfield ought be. Lady Lucas quieted fears
little starting idea gone London get
large party ball; report soon followed Mr. Bingley
bring twelve ladies seven gentlemen assembly.
The girls grieved number ladies, comforted
day ball hearing, instead twelve brought
six London--his five sisters cousin. And
party entered assembly room consisted five
altogether--Mr. Bingley, two sisters, husband eldest,
another young man.

Mr. Bingley good-looking gentlemanlike; pleasant
countenance, easy, unaffected manners. His sisters fine women,
air decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked gentleman; friend Mr. Darcy soon drew attention
room fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien,
report general circulation within five minutes
entrance, ten thousand year. The gentlemen
pronounced fine figure man, ladies declared
much handsomer Mr. Bingley, looked great
admiration half evening, till manners gave disgust
turned tide popularity; discovered
proud; company, pleased;
large estate Derbyshire could save
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, unworthy compared
friend.

Mr. Bingley soon made acquainted principal
people room; lively unreserved, danced every dance,
angry ball closed early, talked giving
one Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak
themselves. What contrast friend! Mr. Darcy danced
Mrs. Hurst Miss Bingley, declined
introduced lady, spent rest evening
walking room, speaking occasionally one party.
His character decided. He proudest, disagreeable man
world, everybody hoped would never come again.
Amongst violent Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike
general behaviour sharpened particular resentment
slighted one daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet obliged, scarcity gentlemen, sit
two dances; part time, Mr. Darcy
standing near enough hear conversation Mr.
Bingley, came dance minutes, press friend
join it.

"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must dance. I hate see
standing stupid manner. You much better
dance."

"I certainly shall not. You know I detest it, unless I
particularly acquainted partner. At assembly
would insupportable. Your sisters engaged,
another woman room would punishment
stand with."

"I would fastidious are," cried Mr. Bingley, "for
kingdom! Upon honour, I never met many pleasant girls
life I evening; several see
uncommonly pretty."

"_You_ dancing handsome girl room," said Mr.
Darcy, looking eldest Miss Bennet.

"Oh! She beautiful creature I ever beheld! But one
sisters sitting behind you, pretty, I
dare say agreeable. Do let ask partner introduce you."

"Which mean?" turning round looked moment
Elizabeth, till catching eye, withdrew coldly said:
"She tolerable, handsome enough tempt _me_; I
humour present give consequence young ladies slighted
men. You better return partner enjoy
smiles, wasting time me."

Mr. Bingley followed advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; Elizabeth
remained cordial feelings toward him. She told story,
however, great spirit among friends; lively,
playful disposition, delighted anything ridiculous.

The evening altogether passed pleasantly whole family. Mrs.
Bennet seen eldest daughter much admired Netherfield
party. Mr. Bingley danced twice,
distinguished sisters. Jane much gratified
mother could be, though quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure. Mary heard mentioned Miss Bingley
accomplished girl neighbourhood; Catherine Lydia
fortunate enough never without partners,
yet learnt care ball. They returned, therefore, good
spirits Longbourn, village lived,
principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
book regardless time; present occasion
good deal curiosity event evening raised
splendid expectations. He rather hoped wife's views
stranger would disappointed; soon found
different story hear.

"Oh! dear Mr. Bennet," entered room, "we
delightful evening, excellent ball. I wish there.
Jane admired, nothing could like it. Everybody said well
looked; Mr. Bingley thought quite beautiful, danced
twice! Only think _that_, dear; actually danced
twice! creature room asked second
time. First all, asked Miss Lucas. I vexed see stand
her! But, however, admire all; indeed, nobody
can, know; seemed quite struck Jane going
dance. So inquired was, got introduced,
asked two next. Then two third danced Miss King,
two fourth Maria Lucas, two fifth Jane again,
two sixth Lizzy, _Boulanger_--"

"If compassion _me_," cried husband impatiently,
"he would danced half much! For God's sake, say
partners. Oh sprained ankle first dance!"

"Oh! dear, I quite delighted him. He excessively
handsome! And sisters charming women. I never life saw
anything elegant dresses. I dare say lace upon Mrs.
Hurst's gown--"

Here interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested
description finery. She therefore obliged seek another branch
subject, related, much bitterness spirit
exaggeration, shocking rudeness Mr. Darcy.

"But I assure you," added, "that Lizzy lose much
suiting _his_ fancy; disagreeable, horrid man,
worth pleasing. So high conceited enduring
him! He walked here, walked there, fancying
great! Not handsome enough dance with! I wish there,
dear, given one set-downs. I quite detest man."



Chapter 4


When Jane Elizabeth alone, former, cautious
praise Mr. Bingley before, expressed sister
much admired him.

"He young man ought be," said she, "sensible,
good-humoured, lively; I never saw happy manners!--so much
ease, perfect good breeding!"

"He also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which young man ought
likewise be, possibly can. His character thereby complete."

"I much flattered asking dance second time. I
expect compliment."

"Did you? I you. But one great difference
us. Compliments always take _you_ surprise, _me_ never. What
could natural asking again? He could help
seeing five times pretty every woman
room. No thanks gallantry that. Well, certainly
agreeable, I give leave like him. You liked many
stupider person."

"Dear Lizzy!"

"Oh! great deal apt, know, like people general.
You never see fault anybody. All world good agreeable
eyes. I never heard speak ill human
life."

"I would wish hasty censuring anyone; I always speak
I think."

"I know do; _that_ makes wonder. With _your_
good sense, honestly blind follies nonsense
others! Affectation candour common enough--one meets
everywhere. But candid without ostentation design--to take
good everybody's character make still better, say nothing
bad--belongs alone. And like man's sisters,
too, you? Their manners equal his."

"Certainly not--at first. But pleasing women
converse them. Miss Bingley live brother, keep
house; I much mistaken shall find charming
neighbour her."

Elizabeth listened silence, convinced; behaviour
assembly calculated please general;
quickness observation less pliancy temper sister,
judgement unassailed attention herself,
little disposed approve them. They fact fine
ladies; deficient good humour pleased,
power making agreeable chose it, proud
conceited. They rather handsome, educated one
first private seminaries town, fortune twenty thousand
pounds, habit spending ought,
associating people rank, therefore every respect
entitled think well themselves, meanly others. They
respectable family north England; circumstance deeply
impressed memories brother's fortune
acquired trade.

Mr. Bingley inherited property amount nearly hundred
thousand pounds father, intended purchase
estate, live it. Mr. Bingley intended likewise,
sometimes made choice county; provided
good house liberty manor, doubtful many
best knew easiness temper, whether might spend
remainder days Netherfield, leave next generation
purchase.

His sisters anxious estate own; but,
though established tenant, Miss Bingley
means unwilling preside table--nor Mrs. Hurst,
married man fashion fortune, less disposed consider
house home suited her. Mr. Bingley
age two years, tempted accidental recommendation
look Netherfield House. He look it,
half-an-hour--was pleased situation principal
rooms, satisfied owner said praise, took
immediately.

Between Darcy steady friendship, spite
great opposition character. Bingley endeared Darcy
easiness, openness, ductility temper, though disposition
could offer greater contrast own, though
never appeared dissatisfied. On strength Darcy's regard, Bingley
firmest reliance, judgement highest opinion.
In understanding, Darcy superior. Bingley means
deficient, Darcy clever. He time haughty,
reserved, fastidious, manners, though well-bred,
inviting. In respect friend greatly advantage. Bingley
sure liked wherever appeared, Darcy continually
giving offense.

The manner spoke Meryton assembly sufficiently
characteristic. Bingley never met pleasant people
prettier girls life; everybody kind attentive
him; formality, stiffness; soon felt
acquainted room; and, Miss Bennet, could
conceive angel beautiful. Darcy, contrary, seen
collection people little beauty fashion,
none felt smallest interest, none received
either attention pleasure. Miss Bennet acknowledged pretty,
smiled much.

Mrs. Hurst sister allowed so--but still admired
liked her, pronounced sweet girl, one
would object know of. Miss Bennet therefore
established sweet girl, brother felt authorized
commendation think chose.



Chapter 5


Within short walk Longbourn lived family Bennets
particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas formerly trade
Meryton, made tolerable fortune, risen
honour knighthood address king mayoralty.
The distinction perhaps felt strongly. It given
disgust business, residence small market town;
and, quitting both, removed family house
mile Meryton, denominated period Lucas Lodge,
could think pleasure importance, and,
unshackled business, occupy solely civil
world. For, though elated rank, render
supercilious; contrary, attention everybody. By
nature inoffensive, friendly, obliging, presentation St.
James's made courteous.

Lady Lucas good kind woman, clever
valuable neighbour Mrs. Bennet. They several children. The eldest
them, sensible, intelligent young woman, twenty-seven,
Elizabeth's intimate friend.

That Miss Lucases Miss Bennets meet talk
ball absolutely necessary; morning assembly
brought former Longbourn hear communicate.

"_You_ began evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet civil
self-command Miss Lucas. "_You_ Mr. Bingley's first choice."

"Yes; seemed like second better."

"Oh! mean Jane, I suppose, danced twice. To
sure _did_ seem admired her--indeed I rather believe
_did_--I heard something it--but I hardly know what--something
Mr. Robinson."

"Perhaps mean I overheard Mr. Robinson;
I mention you? Mr. Robinson's asking liked Meryton
assemblies, whether think great many
pretty women room, _which_ thought prettiest?
answering immediately last question: 'Oh! eldest Miss Bennet,
beyond doubt; cannot two opinions point.'"

"Upon word! Well, decided indeed--that seem
if--but, however, may come nothing, know."

"_My_ overhearings purpose _yours_, Eliza," said
Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy well worth listening friend,
he?--poor Eliza!--to _tolerable_."

"I beg would put Lizzy's head vexed
ill-treatment, disagreeable man, would quite
misfortune liked him. Mrs. Long told last night
sat close half-an-hour without opening lips."

"Are quite sure, ma'am?--is little mistake?" said Jane.
"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking her."

"Aye--because asked last liked Netherfield,
could help answering her; said seemed quite angry
spoke to."

"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that never speaks much,
unless among intimate acquaintances. With _them_ remarkably
agreeable."

"I believe word it, dear. If
agreeable, would talked Mrs. Long. But I guess
was; everybody says eat pride, I dare say
heard somehow Mrs. Long keep carriage, come
ball hack chaise."

"I mind talking Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I
wish danced Eliza."

"Another time, Lizzy," said mother, "I would dance _him_,
I you."

"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise _never_ dance him."

"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does offend _me_ much pride
often does, excuse it. One cannot wonder
fine young man, family, fortune, everything favour,
think highly himself. If I may express it, _right_
proud."

"That true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, mortified _mine_."

"Pride," observed Mary, piqued upon solidity
reflections, "is common failing, I believe. By I
ever read, I convinced common indeed; human
nature particularly prone it, us
cherish feeling self-complacency score
quality other, real imaginary. Vanity pride different
things, though words often used synonymously. A person may
proud without vain. Pride relates opinion
ourselves, vanity would others think us."

"If I rich Mr. Darcy," cried young Lucas, came
sisters, "I care proud I was. I would keep pack
foxhounds, drink bottle wine day."

"Then would drink great deal ought," said Mrs.
Bennet; "and I see it, I take away bottle
directly."

The boy protested not; continued declare
would, argument ended visit.



Chapter 6


The ladies Longbourn soon waited Netherfield. The visit
soon returned due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew
goodwill Mrs. Hurst Miss Bingley; though mother
found intolerable, younger sisters worth speaking to,
wish better acquainted _them_ expressed towards
two eldest. By Jane, attention received greatest
pleasure, Elizabeth still saw superciliousness treatment
everybody, hardly excepting even sister, could like them;
though kindness Jane, was, value arising
probability influence brother's admiration. It
generally evident whenever met, _did_ admire
_her_ equally evident Jane yielding preference
begun entertain first,
way much love; considered pleasure
likely discovered world general, since Jane
united, great strength feeling, composure temper
uniform cheerfulness manner would guard suspicions
impertinent. She mentioned friend Miss Lucas.

"It may perhaps pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to able impose
public case; sometimes disadvantage
guarded. If woman conceals affection skill
object it, may lose opportunity fixing him;
poor consolation believe world equally
dark. There much gratitude vanity almost every
attachment, safe leave itself. We
_begin_ freely--a slight preference natural enough;
us heart enough really love without
encouragement. In nine cases ten women better show _more_
affection feels. Bingley likes sister undoubtedly;
may never like her, help on."

"But help on, much nature allow. If I
perceive regard him, must simpleton, indeed,
discover too."

"Remember, Eliza, know Jane's disposition do."

"But woman partial man, endeavour conceal
it, must find out."

"Perhaps must, sees enough her. But, though Bingley Jane
meet tolerably often, never many hours together; and,
always see large mixed parties, impossible
every moment employed conversing together. Jane
therefore make every half-hour command
attention. When secure him, leisure
falling love much chooses."

"Your plan good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing
question desire well married, I determined
get rich husband, husband, I dare say I adopt it. But
Jane's feelings; acting design. As yet,
cannot even certain degree regard
reasonableness. She known fortnight. She danced four
dances Meryton; saw one morning house,
since dined company four times. This quite
enough make understand character."

"Not represent it. Had merely _dined_ him, might
discovered whether good appetite; must
remember four evenings also spent together--and four
evenings may great deal."

"Yes; four evenings enabled ascertain
like Vingt-un better Commerce; respect
leading characteristic, I imagine much unfolded."

"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success heart;
married to-morrow, I think good
chance happiness studying character
twelvemonth. Happiness marriage entirely matter chance. If
dispositions parties ever well known
ever similar beforehand, advance felicity
least. They always continue grow sufficiently unlike afterwards
share vexation; better know little
possible defects person pass
life."

"You make laugh, Charlotte; sound. You know
sound, would never act way yourself."

Occupied observing Mr. Bingley's attentions sister, Elizabeth
far suspecting becoming object
interest eyes friend. Mr. Darcy first scarcely
allowed pretty; looked without admiration
ball; next met, looked criticise. But
sooner made clear friends hardly
good feature face, began find rendered
uncommonly intelligent beautiful expression dark eyes. To
discovery succeeded others equally mortifying. Though
detected critical eye one failure perfect symmetry
form, forced acknowledge figure light
pleasing; spite asserting manners
fashionable world, caught easy playfulness. Of
perfectly unaware; man made
agreeable nowhere, thought handsome enough
dance with.

He began wish know her, step towards conversing
himself, attended conversation others. His
drew notice. It Sir William Lucas's, large party
assembled.

"What Mr. Darcy mean," said Charlotte, "by listening
conversation Colonel Forster?"

"That question Mr. Darcy answer."

"But I shall certainly let know I see
about. He satirical eye, I begin
impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid him."

On approaching soon afterwards, though without seeming
intention speaking, Miss Lucas defied friend mention
subject him; immediately provoking Elizabeth it,
turned said:

"Did think, Mr. Darcy, I expressed uncommonly
well now, I teasing Colonel Forster give us ball
Meryton?"

"With great energy; always subject makes lady
energetic."

"You severe us."

"It _her_ turn soon teased," said Miss Lucas. "I going
open instrument, Eliza, know follows."

"You strange creature way friend!--always wanting
play sing anybody everybody! If vanity taken
musical turn, would invaluable; is, I would
really rather sit must habit
hearing best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
added, "Very well, must so, must." And gravely glancing
Mr. Darcy, "There fine old saying, everybody
course familiar with: 'Keep breath cool porridge'; I
shall keep mine swell song."

Her performance pleasing, though means capital. After song
two, could reply entreaties several
would sing again, eagerly succeeded instrument
sister Mary, having, consequence plain one
family, worked hard knowledge accomplishments, always
impatient display.

Mary neither genius taste; though vanity given
application, given likewise pedantic air conceited
manner, would injured higher degree excellence
reached. Elizabeth, easy unaffected, listened
much pleasure, though playing half well; Mary,
end long concerto, glad purchase praise gratitude
Scotch Irish airs, request younger sisters, who,
Lucases, two three officers, joined eagerly
dancing one end room.

Mr. Darcy stood near silent indignation mode
passing evening, exclusion conversation,
much engrossed thoughts perceive Sir William Lucas
neighbour, till Sir William thus began:

"What charming amusement young people is, Mr. Darcy! There
nothing like dancing all. I consider one first
refinements polished society."

"Certainly, sir; advantage also vogue amongst
less polished societies world. Every savage dance."

Sir William smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully,"
continued pause, seeing Bingley join group; "and I doubt
adept science yourself, Mr. Darcy."

"You saw dance Meryton, I believe, sir."

"Yes, indeed, received inconsiderable pleasure sight. Do
often dance St. James's?"

"Never, sir."

"Do think would proper compliment place?"

"It compliment I never pay place I avoid it."

"You house town, I conclude?"

Mr. Darcy bowed.

"I thought fixing town myself--for I fond
superior society; I feel quite certain air
London would agree Lady Lucas."

He paused hopes answer; companion disposed
make any; Elizabeth instant moving towards them,
struck action gallant thing, called
her:

"My dear Miss Eliza, dancing? Mr. Darcy, must allow
present young lady desirable partner. You
cannot refuse dance, I sure much beauty you."
And, taking hand, would given Mr. Darcy who, though
extremely surprised, unwilling receive it, instantly
drew back, said discomposure Sir William:

"Indeed, sir, I least intention dancing. I entreat
suppose I moved way order beg partner."

Mr. Darcy, grave propriety, requested allowed honour
hand, vain. Elizabeth determined; Sir William
shake purpose attempt persuasion.

"You excel much dance, Miss Eliza, cruel deny
happiness seeing you; though gentleman dislikes
amusement general, objection, I sure, oblige us
one half-hour."

"Mr. Darcy politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.

"He is, indeed; but, considering inducement, dear Miss Eliza,
cannot wonder complaisance--for would object
partner?"

Elizabeth looked archly, turned away. Her resistance
injured gentleman, thinking
complacency, thus accosted Miss Bingley:

"I guess subject reverie."

"I imagine not."

"You considering insupportable would pass many evenings
manner--in society; indeed I quite opinion.
I never annoyed! The insipidity, yet noise--the
nothingness, yet self-importance people! What would
I give hear strictures them!"

"Your conjecture totally wrong, I assure you. My mind
agreeably engaged. I meditating great pleasure
pair fine eyes face pretty woman bestow."

Miss Bingley immediately fixed eyes face, desired
would tell lady credit inspiring reflections.
Mr. Darcy replied great intrepidity:

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I astonishment.
How long favourite?--and pray, I wish
joy?"

"That exactly question I expected ask. A lady's
imagination rapid; jumps admiration love, love
matrimony, moment. I knew would wishing joy."

"Nay, serious it, I shall consider matter
absolutely settled. You charming mother-in-law, indeed;
and, course, always Pemberley you."

He listened perfect indifference chose
entertain manner; composure convinced
safe, wit flowed long.



Chapter 7


Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely estate two
thousand year, which, unfortunately daughters, entailed,
default heirs male, distant relation; mother's
fortune, though ample situation life, could ill supply
deficiency his. Her father attorney Meryton,
left four thousand pounds.

She sister married Mr. Phillips, clerk
father succeeded business, brother settled
London respectable line trade.

The village Longbourn one mile Meryton;
convenient distance young ladies, usually tempted
thither three four times week, pay duty aunt
milliner's shop way. The two youngest family,
Catherine Lydia, particularly frequent attentions;
minds vacant sisters', nothing
better offered, walk Meryton necessary amuse morning
hours furnish conversation evening; however bare news
country general might be, always contrived learn
aunt. At present, indeed, well supplied
news happiness recent arrival militia regiment
neighbourhood; remain whole winter, Meryton
headquarters.

Their visits Mrs. Phillips productive
interesting intelligence. Every day added something knowledge
officers' names connections. Their lodgings long
secret, length began know officers themselves. Mr.
Phillips visited all, opened nieces store
felicity unknown before. They could talk nothing officers;
Mr. Bingley's large fortune, mention gave animation
mother, worthless eyes opposed
regimentals ensign.

After listening one morning effusions subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed:

"From I collect manner talking, must two
silliest girls country. I suspected time,
I convinced."

Catherine disconcerted, made answer; Lydia, perfect
indifference, continued express admiration Captain Carter,
hope seeing course day, going
next morning London.

"I astonished, dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that
ready think children silly. If I wished think slightingly
anybody's children, own, however."

"If children silly, I must hope always sensible it."

"Yes--but happens, clever."

"This point, I flatter myself, agree. I
hoped sentiments coincided every particular, I must
far differ think two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."

"My dear Mr. Bennet, must expect girls sense
father mother. When get age, I dare say
think officers do. I remember time
I liked red coat well--and, indeed, I still
heart; smart young colonel, five six thousand year,
want one girls I shall say nay him; I thought
Colonel Forster looked becoming night Sir William's
regimentals."

"Mamma," cried Lydia, "my aunt says Colonel Forster Captain
Carter go often Miss Watson's first
came; sees often standing Clarke's library."

Mrs. Bennet prevented replying entrance footman
note Miss Bennet; came Netherfield, servant waited
answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled pleasure,
eagerly calling out, daughter read,

"Well, Jane, from? What about? What say? Well,
Jane, make haste tell us; make haste, love."

"It Miss Bingley," said Jane, read aloud.

"MY DEAR FRIEND,--

"If compassionate dine to-day Louisa me,
shall danger hating rest lives,
whole day's tete-a-tete two women never end without
quarrel. Come soon receipt this. My brother
gentlemen dine officers.--Yours ever,

"CAROLINE BINGLEY"

"With officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder aunt tell us
_that_."

"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that unlucky."

"Can I carriage?" said Jane.

"No, dear, better go horseback, seems likely
rain; must stay night."

"That would good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if sure
would offer send home."

"Oh! gentlemen Mr. Bingley's chaise go Meryton,
Hursts horses theirs."

"I much rather go coach."

"But, dear, father cannot spare horses, I sure. They
wanted farm, Mr. Bennet, not?"

"They wanted farm much oftener I get them."

"But got to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
answered."

She last extort father acknowledgment horses
engaged. Jane therefore obliged go horseback,
mother attended door many cheerful prognostics
bad day. Her hopes answered; Jane gone long
rained hard. Her sisters uneasy her, mother
delighted. The rain continued whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could come back.

"This lucky idea mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet
once, credit making rain own. Till
next morning, however, aware felicity
contrivance. Breakfast scarcely servant Netherfield
brought following note Elizabeth:

"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--

"I find unwell morning, which, I suppose,
imputed getting wet yesterday. My kind friends
hear returning till I better. They insist also seeing Mr.
Jones--therefore alarmed hear
me--and, excepting sore throat headache, much
matter me.--Yours, etc."

"Well, dear," said Mr. Bennet, Elizabeth read note
aloud, "if daughter dangerous fit illness--if
die, would comfort know pursuit
Mr. Bingley, orders."

"Oh! I afraid dying. People die little trifling
colds. She taken good care of. As long stays there,
well. I would go see I could carriage."

Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined go her, though
carriage had; horsewoman, walking
alternative. She declared resolution.

"How silly," cried mother, "as think
thing, dirt! You fit seen get
there."

"I shall fit see Jane--which I want."

"Is hint me, Lizzy," said father, "to send
horses?"

"No, indeed, I wish avoid walk. The distance nothing
one motive; three miles. I shall back dinner."

"I admire activity benevolence," observed Mary, "but every
impulse feeling guided reason; and, opinion,
exertion always proportion required."

"We go far Meryton you," said Catherine Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted company, three young ladies set
together.

"If make haste," said Lydia, walked along, "perhaps may
see something Captain Carter goes."

In Meryton parted; two youngest repaired lodgings one
officers' wives, Elizabeth continued walk alone, crossing
field field quick pace, jumping stiles springing
puddles impatient activity, finding last
within view house, weary ankles, dirty stockings, face
glowing warmth exercise.

She shown breakfast-parlour, Jane
assembled, appearance created great deal surprise.
That walked three miles early day,
dirty weather, herself, almost incredible Mrs. Hurst
Miss Bingley; Elizabeth convinced held contempt
it. She received, however, politely them;
brother's manners something better politeness;
good humour kindness. Mr. Darcy said little, Mr.
Hurst nothing all. The former divided admiration
brilliancy exercise given complexion, doubt
occasion's justifying coming far alone. The latter
thinking breakfast.

Her inquiries sister favourably answered. Miss
Bennet slept ill, though up, feverish,
well enough leave room. Elizabeth glad taken
immediately; Jane, withheld fear giving
alarm inconvenience expressing note much longed
visit, delighted entrance. She equal,
however, much conversation, Miss Bingley left
together, could attempt little besides expressions gratitude
extraordinary kindness treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
her.

When breakfast joined sisters; Elizabeth
began like herself, saw much affection
solicitude showed Jane. The apothecary came,
examined patient, said, might supposed, caught
violent cold, must endeavour get better it;
advised return bed, promised draughts. The advice
followed readily, feverish symptoms increased, head
ached acutely. Elizabeth quit room moment;
ladies often absent; gentlemen out, had,
fact, nothing elsewhere.

When clock struck three, Elizabeth felt must go,
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered carriage,
wanted little pressing accept it, Jane testified concern
parting her, Miss Bingley obliged convert offer
chaise invitation remain Netherfield present.
Elizabeth thankfully consented, servant dispatched
Longbourn acquaint family stay bring back supply
clothes.



Chapter 8


At five o'clock two ladies retired dress, half-past six
Elizabeth summoned dinner. To civil inquiries
poured in, amongst pleasure distinguishing
much superior solicitude Mr. Bingley's, could make
favourable answer. Jane means better. The sisters, hearing
this, repeated three four times much grieved,
shocking bad cold, excessively disliked
ill themselves; thought matter:
indifference towards Jane immediately restored
Elizabeth enjoyment former dislike.

Their brother, indeed, one party could
regard complacency. His anxiety Jane evident,
attentions pleasing, prevented feeling
much intruder believed considered
others. She little notice him. Miss Bingley
engrossed Mr. Darcy, sister scarcely less so; Mr.
Hurst, Elizabeth sat, indolent man, lived
eat, drink, play cards; who, found prefer plain
dish ragout, nothing say her.

When dinner over, returned directly Jane, Miss Bingley
began abusing soon room. Her manners
pronounced bad indeed, mixture pride impertinence;
conversation, style, beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought
same, added:

"She nothing, short, recommend her, excellent
walker. I shall never forget appearance morning. She really
looked almost wild."

"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep countenance. Very
nonsensical come all! Why must _she_ scampering
country, sister cold? Her hair, untidy, blowsy!"

"Yes, petticoat; I hope saw petticoat, six inches deep
mud, I absolutely certain; gown let
hide office."

"Your picture may exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but
lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well came room morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
escaped notice."

"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I
inclined think would wish see _your_ sister make
exhibition."

"Certainly not."

"To walk three miles, four miles, five miles, whatever is,
ankles dirt, alone, quite alone! What could mean
it? It seems show abominable sort conceited independence,
country-town indifference decorum."

"It shows affection sister pleasing," said
Bingley.

"I afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley half whisper, "that
adventure rather affected admiration fine eyes."

"Not all," replied; "they brightened exercise." A
short pause followed speech, Mrs. Hurst began again:

"I excessive regard Miss Jane Bennet, really
sweet girl, I wish heart well settled. But
father mother, low connections, I afraid
chance it."

"I think I heard say uncle attorney
Meryton."

"Yes; another, lives somewhere near Cheapside."

"That capital," added sister, laughed heartily.

"If uncles enough fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would make one jot less agreeable."

"But must materially lessen chance marrying men
consideration world," replied Darcy.

To speech Bingley made answer; sisters gave
hearty assent, indulged mirth time expense
dear friend's vulgar relations.

With renewal tenderness, however, returned room
leaving dining-parlour, sat till summoned coffee.
She still poorly, Elizabeth would quit all, till
late evening, comfort seeing sleep,
seemed rather right pleasant go
downstairs herself. On entering drawing-room found whole
party loo, immediately invited join them; suspecting
playing high declined it, making sister
excuse, said would amuse short time could stay
below, book. Mr. Hurst looked astonishment.

"Do prefer reading cards?" said he; "that rather singular."

"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She great
reader, pleasure anything else."

"I deserve neither praise censure," cried Elizabeth; "I
_not_ great reader, I pleasure many things."

"In nursing sister I sure pleasure," said Bingley; "and
I hope soon increased seeing quite well."

Elizabeth thanked heart, walked towards
table books lying. He immediately offered fetch
others--all library afforded.

"And I wish collection larger benefit
credit; I idle fellow, though I many, I
I ever looked into."

Elizabeth assured could suit perfectly
room.

"I astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that father left
small collection books. What delightful library
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"

"It ought good," replied, "it work many
generations."

"And added much yourself, always buying
books."

"I cannot comprehend neglect family library days
these."

"Neglect! I sure neglect nothing add beauties
noble place. Charles, build _your_ house, I wish may
half delightful Pemberley."

"I wish may."

"But I would really advise make purchase
neighbourhood, take Pemberley kind model. There
finer county England Derbyshire."

"With heart; I buy Pemberley Darcy sell it."

"I talking possibilities, Charles."

"Upon word, Caroline, I think possible get
Pemberley purchase imitation."

Elizabeth much caught passed, leave
little attention book; soon laying wholly aside, drew
near card-table, stationed Mr. Bingley
eldest sister, observe game.

"Is Miss Darcy much grown since spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will
tall I am?"

"I think will. She Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height,
rather taller."

"How I long see again! I never met anybody delighted
much. Such countenance, manners! And extremely accomplished
age! Her performance pianoforte exquisite."

"It amazing me," said Bingley, "how young ladies patience
accomplished are."

"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, mean?"

"Yes, them, I think. They paint tables, cover screens,
net purses. I scarcely know anyone cannot this, I sure
I never heard young lady spoken first time, without
informed accomplished."

"Your list common extent accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
much truth. The word applied many woman deserves
otherwise netting purse covering screen. But I
far agreeing estimation ladies general. I
cannot boast knowing half-a-dozen, whole range
acquaintance, really accomplished."

"Nor I, I sure," said Miss Bingley.

"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend great deal
idea accomplished woman."

"Yes, I comprehend great deal it."

"Oh! certainly," cried faithful assistant, "no one really
esteemed accomplished greatly surpass usually met
with. A woman must thorough knowledge music, singing, drawing,
dancing, modern languages, deserve word; besides
this, must possess certain something air manner
walking, tone voice, address expressions, word
half-deserved."

"All must possess," added Darcy, "and must
yet add something substantial, improvement mind
extensive reading."

"I longer surprised knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
I rather wonder knowing _any_."

"Are severe upon sex doubt possibility
this?"

"I never saw woman. I never saw capacity, taste,
application, elegance, describe united."

Mrs. Hurst Miss Bingley cried injustice
implied doubt, protesting knew many women
answered description, Mr. Hurst called order,
bitter complaints inattention going forward. As
conversation thereby end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left
room.

"Elizabeth Bennet," said Miss Bingley, door closed her,
"is one young ladies seek recommend
sex undervaluing own; many men, I dare say,
succeeds. But, opinion, paltry device, mean art."

"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, remark chiefly addressed,
"there meanness _all_ arts ladies sometimes condescend
employ captivation. Whatever bears affinity cunning
despicable."

Miss Bingley entirely satisfied reply
continue subject.

Elizabeth joined say sister worse,
could leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones sent
immediately; sisters, convinced country advice could
service, recommended express town one
eminent physicians. This would hear of;
unwilling comply brother's proposal; settled
Mr. Jones sent early morning, Miss Bennet
decidedly better. Bingley quite uncomfortable; sisters
declared miserable. They solaced wretchedness,
however, duets supper, could find better relief
feelings giving housekeeper directions every
attention might paid sick lady sister.



Chapter 9


Elizabeth passed chief night sister's room,
morning pleasure able send tolerable answer
inquiries early received Mr. Bingley housemaid,
time afterwards two elegant ladies waited
sisters. In spite amendment, however, requested
note sent Longbourn, desiring mother visit Jane, form
judgement situation. The note immediately dispatched,
contents quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon family breakfast.

Had found Jane apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would
miserable; satisfied seeing illness
alarming, wish recovering immediately,
restoration health would probably remove Netherfield. She
would listen, therefore, daughter's proposal carried
home; neither apothecary, arrived time, think
advisable. After sitting little Jane, Miss
Bingley's appearance invitation, mother three daughters
attended breakfast parlour. Bingley met hopes
Mrs. Bennet found Miss Bennet worse expected.

"Indeed I have, sir," answer. "She great deal ill
moved. Mr. Jones says must think moving her. We must trespass
little longer kindness."

"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must thought of. My sister, I
sure, hear removal."

"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, cold civility,
"that Miss Bennet receive every possible attention
remains us."

Mrs. Bennet profuse acknowledgments.

"I sure," added, "if good friends I
know would become her, ill indeed, suffers
vast deal, though greatest patience world,
always way her, has, without exception, sweetest
temper I ever met with. I often tell girls
nothing _her_. You sweet room here, Mr. Bingley,
charming prospect gravel walk. I know place
country equal Netherfield. You think quitting
hurry, I hope, though short lease."

"Whatever I done hurry," replied he; "and therefore I
resolve quit Netherfield, I probably five
minutes. At present, however, I consider quite fixed here."

"That exactly I supposed you," said Elizabeth.

"You begin comprehend me, you?" cried he, turning towards her.

"Oh! yes--I understand perfectly."

"I wish I might take compliment; easily seen
I afraid pitiful."

"That happens. It follow deep, intricate
character less estimable one yours."

"Lizzy," cried mother, "remember are, run
wild manner suffered home."

"I know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that
studier character. It must amusing study."

"Yes, intricate characters _most_ amusing. They
least advantage."

"The country," said Darcy, "can general supply subjects
study. In country neighbourhood move confined
unvarying society."

"But people alter much, something new
observed ever."

"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended manner mentioning
country neighbourhood. "I assure quite much _that_
going country town."

Everybody surprised, Darcy, looking moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, fancied gained complete
victory him, continued triumph.

"I cannot see London great advantage country,
part, except shops public places. The country vast deal
pleasanter, not, Mr. Bingley?"

"When I country," replied, "I never wish leave it;
I town pretty much same. They
advantages, I equally happy either."

"Aye--that right disposition. But
gentleman," looking Darcy, "seemed think country nothing
all."

"Indeed, Mamma, mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing
mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He meant
variety people met country town,
must acknowledge true."

"Certainly, dear, nobody said were; meeting
many people neighbourhood, I believe
neighbourhoods larger. I know dine four-and-twenty families."

Nothing concern Elizabeth could enable Bingley keep
countenance. His sister less delicate, directed eyes towards
Mr. Darcy expressive smile. Elizabeth, sake
saying something might turn mother's thoughts, asked
Charlotte Lucas Longbourn since _her_ coming away.

"Yes, called yesterday father. What agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley, he? So much man fashion! So
genteel easy! He always something say everybody. _That_
idea good breeding; persons fancy
important, never open mouths, quite mistake matter."

"Did Charlotte dine you?"

"No, would go home. I fancy wanted mince-pies. For
part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants work;
_my_ daughters brought differently. But everybody
judge themselves, Lucases good sort girls,
I assure you. It pity handsome! Not I think
Charlotte _very_ plain--but particular friend."

"She seems pleasant young woman."

"Oh! dear, yes; must plain. Lady Lucas
often said so, envied Jane's beauty. I like boast
child, sure, Jane--one often see anybody
better looking. It everybody says. I trust
partiality. When fifteen, man brother
Gardiner's town much love sister-in-law
sure would make offer came away. But, however,
not. Perhaps thought young. However, wrote verses
her, pretty were."

"And ended affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There
many one, I fancy, overcome way. I wonder first
discovered efficacy poetry driving away love!"

"I used consider poetry _food_ love," said Darcy.

"Of fine, stout, healthy love may. Everything nourishes
strong already. But slight, thin sort inclination, I
convinced one good sonnet starve entirely away."

Darcy smiled; general pause ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest mother exposing again. She longed
speak, could think nothing say; short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating thanks Mr. Bingley kindness
Jane, apology troubling also Lizzy. Mr. Bingley
unaffectedly civil answer, forced younger sister
civil also, say occasion required. She performed part
indeed without much graciousness, Mrs. Bennet satisfied,
soon afterwards ordered carriage. Upon signal, youngest
daughters put forward. The two girls whispering
whole visit, result was,
youngest tax Mr. Bingley promised first coming
country give ball Netherfield.

Lydia stout, well-grown girl fifteen, fine complexion
good-humoured countenance; favourite mother, whose
affection brought public early age. She high
animal spirits, sort natural self-consequence,
attention officers, uncle's good dinners,
easy manners recommended her, increased assurance. She
equal, therefore, address Mr. Bingley subject ball,
abruptly reminded promise; adding, would
shameful thing world keep it. His answer
sudden attack delightful mother's ear:

"I perfectly ready, I assure you, keep engagement;
sister recovered, shall, please, name day
ball. But would wish dancing ill."

Lydia declared satisfied. "Oh! yes--it would much better
wait till Jane well, time likely Captain Carter
would Meryton again. And given _your_ ball,"
added, "I shall insist giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster quite shame not."

Mrs. Bennet daughters departed, Elizabeth returned
instantly Jane, leaving relations' behaviour
remarks two ladies Mr. Darcy; latter whom, however,
could prevailed join censure _her_, spite
Miss Bingley's witticisms _fine eyes_.



Chapter 10


The day passed much day done. Mrs. Hurst Miss
Bingley spent hours morning invalid,
continued, though slowly, mend; evening Elizabeth joined
party drawing-room. The loo-table, however, appear.
Mr. Darcy writing, Miss Bingley, seated near him, watching
progress letter repeatedly calling attention
messages sister. Mr. Hurst Mr. Bingley piquet,
Mrs. Hurst observing game.

Elizabeth took needlework, sufficiently amused
attending passed Darcy companion. The perpetual
commendations lady, either handwriting, evenness
lines, length letter, perfect unconcern
praises received, formed curious dialogue,
exactly union opinion each.

"How delighted Miss Darcy receive letter!"

He made answer.

"You write uncommonly fast."

"You mistaken. I write rather slowly."

"How many letters must occasion write course
year! Letters business, too! How odious I think them!"

"It fortunate, then, fall lot instead yours."

"Pray tell sister I long see her."

"I already told once, desire."

"I afraid like pen. Let mend you. I mend
pens remarkably well."

"Thank you--but I always mend own."

"How contrive write even?"

He silent.

"Tell sister I delighted hear improvement harp;
pray let know I quite raptures beautiful
little design table, I think infinitely superior Miss
Grantley's."

"Will give leave defer raptures till I write again? At
present I room justice."

"Oh! consequence. I shall see January. But
always write charming long letters her, Mr. Darcy?"

"They generally long; whether always charming
determine."

"It rule me, person write long letter
ease, cannot write ill."

"That compliment Darcy, Caroline," cried
brother, "because _not_ write ease. He studies much
words four syllables. Do you, Darcy?"

"My style writing different yours."

"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes careless way
imaginable. He leaves half words, blots rest."

"My ideas flow rapidly I time express them--by
means letters sometimes convey ideas correspondents."

"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."

"Nothing deceitful," said Darcy, "than appearance
humility. It often carelessness opinion, sometimes
indirect boast."

"And two call _my_ little recent piece modesty?"

"The indirect boast; really proud defects
writing, consider proceeding rapidity
thought carelessness execution, which, estimable,
think least highly interesting. The power anything
quickness always prized much possessor, often without
attention imperfection performance. When told Mrs.
Bennet morning ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield
gone five minutes, meant sort
panegyric, compliment yourself--and yet
laudable precipitance must leave necessary business
undone, real advantage anyone else?"

"Nay," cried Bingley, "this much, remember night
foolish things said morning. And yet, upon honour,
I believe I said true, I believe
moment. At least, therefore, I assume character needless
precipitance merely show ladies."

"I dare say believed it; I means convinced
would gone celerity. Your conduct would quite
dependent chance man I know; if,
mounting horse, friend say, 'Bingley, better
stay till next week,' would probably it, would probably
go--and another word, might stay month."

"You proved this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley
justice disposition. You shown much
himself."

"I exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by converting
friend says compliment sweetness temper. But I
afraid giving turn gentleman means
intend; would certainly think better me,
circumstance I give flat denial, ride fast I
could."

"Would Mr. Darcy consider rashness original intentions
atoned obstinacy adhering it?"

"Upon word, I cannot exactly explain matter; Darcy must speak
himself."

"You expect account opinions choose call mine,
I never acknowledged. Allowing case, however,
stand according representation, must remember, Miss Bennet,
friend supposed desire return house,
delay plan, merely desired it, asked without offering
one argument favour propriety."

"To yield readily--easily--to _persuasion_ friend merit
you."

"To yield without conviction compliment understanding
either."

"You appear me, Mr. Darcy, allow nothing influence
friendship affection. A regard requester would often make
one readily yield request, without waiting arguments reason
one it. I particularly speaking case
supposed Mr. Bingley. We may well wait, perhaps, till
circumstance occurs discuss discretion behaviour
thereupon. But general ordinary cases friend friend,
one desired change resolution
great moment, think ill person complying
desire, without waiting argued it?"

"Will advisable, proceed subject,
arrange rather precision degree importance
appertain request, well degree intimacy subsisting
parties?"

"By means," cried Bingley; "let us hear particulars,
forgetting comparative height size;
weight argument, Miss Bennet, may aware of. I assure
you, Darcy great tall fellow, comparison
myself, I pay half much deference. I declare I
know awful object Darcy, particular occasions,
particular places; house especially, Sunday evening,
nothing do."

Mr. Darcy smiled; Elizabeth thought could perceive
rather offended, therefore checked laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented indignity received, expostulation
brother talking nonsense.

"I see design, Bingley," said friend. "You dislike argument,
want silence this."

"Perhaps I do. Arguments much like disputes. If Miss
Bennet defer till I room, I shall
thankful; may say whatever like me."

"What ask," said Elizabeth, "is sacrifice side; Mr.
Darcy much better finish letter."

Mr. Darcy took advice, finish letter.

When business over, applied Miss Bingley Elizabeth
indulgence music. Miss Bingley moved alacrity
pianoforte; and, polite request Elizabeth would lead
way politely earnestly negatived,
seated herself.

Mrs. Hurst sang sister, thus employed,
Elizabeth could help observing, turned music-books
lay instrument, frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes fixed
her. She hardly knew suppose could object
admiration great man; yet look
disliked her, still strange. She could imagine,
however, last drew notice something
wrong reprehensible, according ideas right,
person present. The supposition pain her. She liked
little care approbation.

After playing Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied charm
lively Scotch air; soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said her:

"Do feel great inclination, Miss Bennet, seize
opportunity dancing reel?"

She smiled, made answer. He repeated question,
surprise silence.

"Oh!" said she, "I heard before, I could immediately
determine say reply. You wanted me, I know, say 'Yes,'
might pleasure despising taste; I always
delight overthrowing kind schemes, cheating person
premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made mind tell
you, I want dance reel all--and despise
dare."

"Indeed I dare."

Elizabeth, rather expected affront him, amazed
gallantry; mixture sweetness archness
manner made difficult affront anybody; Darcy
never bewitched woman her. He really
believed, inferiority connections,
danger.

Miss Bingley saw, suspected enough jealous; great
anxiety recovery dear friend Jane received
assistance desire getting rid Elizabeth.

She often tried provoke Darcy disliking guest, talking
supposed marriage, planning happiness alliance.

"I hope," said she, walking together shrubbery
next day, "you give mother-in-law hints,
desirable event takes place, advantage holding tongue;
compass it, cure younger girls running
officers. And, I may mention delicate subject, endeavour
check little something, bordering conceit impertinence,
lady possesses."

"Have anything else propose domestic felicity?"

"Oh! yes. Do let portraits uncle aunt Phillips placed
gallery Pemberley. Put next great-uncle
judge. They profession, know, different
lines. As Elizabeth's picture, must taken,
painter could justice beautiful eyes?"

"It would easy, indeed, catch expression,
colour shape, eyelashes, remarkably fine, might
copied."

At moment met another walk Mrs. Hurst
Elizabeth herself.

"I know intended walk," said Miss Bingley,
confusion, lest overheard.

"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "running away without
telling us coming out."

Then taking disengaged arm Mr. Darcy, left Elizabeth walk
herself. The path admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt rudeness,
immediately said:

"This walk wide enough party. We better go
avenue."

But Elizabeth, least inclination remain them,
laughingly answered:

"No, no; stay are. You charmingly grouped, appear
uncommon advantage. The picturesque would spoilt admitting
fourth. Good-bye."

She ran gaily off, rejoicing rambled about, hope
home day two. Jane already much recovered
intend leaving room couple hours evening.



Chapter 11


When ladies removed dinner, Elizabeth ran
sister, seeing well guarded cold, attended
drawing-room, welcomed two friends many
professions pleasure; Elizabeth never seen agreeable
hour passed gentlemen appeared.
Their powers conversation considerable. They could describe
entertainment accuracy, relate anecdote humour, laugh
acquaintance spirit.

But gentlemen entered, Jane longer first object;
Miss Bingley's eyes instantly turned toward Darcy,
something say advanced many steps. He addressed
Miss Bennet, polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also
made slight bow, said "very glad;" diffuseness
warmth remained Bingley's salutation. He full joy
attention. The first half-hour spent piling fire, lest
suffer change room; removed desire
side fireplace, might
door. He sat her, talked scarcely anyone
else. Elizabeth, work opposite corner, saw great
delight.

When tea over, Mr. Hurst reminded sister-in-law
card-table--but vain. She obtained private intelligence Mr.
Darcy wish cards; Mr. Hurst soon found even open
petition rejected. She assured one intended play,
silence whole party subject seemed justify her. Mr.
Hurst therefore nothing do, stretch one
sofas go sleep. Darcy took book; Miss Bingley same;
Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied playing bracelets
rings, joined brother's conversation Miss
Bennet.

Miss Bingley's attention quite much engaged watching Mr.
Darcy's progress _his_ book, reading own;
perpetually either making inquiry, looking page. She
could win him, however, conversation; merely answered
question, read on. At length, quite exhausted attempt
amused book, chosen
second volume his, gave great yawn said, "How pleasant
spend evening way! I declare
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires anything
book! When I house own, I shall miserable I
excellent library."

No one made reply. She yawned again, threw aside book,
cast eyes round room quest amusement; hearing
brother mentioning ball Miss Bennet, turned suddenly
towards said:

"By bye, Charles, really serious meditating dance
Netherfield? I would advise you, determine it, consult
wishes present party; I much mistaken
among us ball would rather punishment
pleasure."

"If mean Darcy," cried brother, "he may go bed,
chooses, begins--but ball, quite settled
thing; soon Nicholls made white soup enough, I shall send
round cards."

"I like balls infinitely better," replied, "if
carried different manner; something insufferably
tedious usual process meeting. It would surely much
rational conversation instead dancing made order
day."

"Much rational, dear Caroline, I dare say, would
near much like ball."

Miss Bingley made answer, soon afterwards got walked
room. Her figure elegant, walked well;
Darcy, aimed, still inflexibly studious. In
desperation feelings, resolved one effort more, and,
turning Elizabeth, said:

"Miss Eliza Bennet, let persuade follow example, take
turn room. I assure refreshing sitting
long one attitude."

Elizabeth surprised, agreed immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded less real object civility; Mr. Darcy looked
up. He much awake novelty attention quarter
Elizabeth could be, unconsciously closed book. He
directly invited join party, declined it, observing
could imagine two motives choosing walk
room together, either motives joining would
interfere. "What could mean? She dying know could
meaning?"--and asked Elizabeth whether could understand him?

"Not all," answer; "but depend upon it, means severe
us, surest way disappointing ask nothing
it."

Miss Bingley, however, incapable disappointing Mr. Darcy
anything, persevered therefore requiring explanation
two motives.

"I smallest objection explaining them," said he, soon
allowed speak. "You either choose method passing
evening other's confidence, secret
affairs discuss, conscious figures
appear greatest advantage walking; first, I would
completely way, second, I admire much better
I sit fire."

"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard anything
abominable. How shall punish speech?"

"Nothing easy, inclination," said Elizabeth. "We
plague punish one another. Tease him--laugh him. Intimate
are, must know done."

"But upon honour, I _not_. I assure intimacy
yet taught _that_. Tease calmness manner presence
mind! No, no; I feel may defy us there. And laughter,
expose ourselves, please, attempting laugh without
subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself."

"Mr. Darcy laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That
uncommon advantage, uncommon I hope continue, would
great loss _me_ many acquaintances. I dearly love
laugh."

"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given credit be.
The wisest best men--nay, wisest best
actions--may rendered ridiculous person whose first object
life joke."

"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there people, I hope I
one _them_. I hope I never ridicule wise good.
Follies nonsense, whims inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,
I laugh whenever I can. But these, I suppose, precisely
without."

"Perhaps possible anyone. But study
life avoid weaknesses often expose strong
understanding ridicule."

"Such vanity pride."

"Yes, vanity weakness indeed. But pride--where real
superiority mind, pride always good regulation."

Elizabeth turned away hide smile.

"Your examination Mr. Darcy over, I presume," said Miss Bingley;
"and pray result?"

"I perfectly convinced Mr. Darcy defect. He owns
without disguise."

"No," said Darcy, "I made pretension. I faults enough,
not, I hope, understanding. My temper I dare vouch
for. It is, I believe, little yielding--certainly little
convenience world. I cannot forget follies vices others
soon I ought, offenses myself. My feelings
puffed every attempt move them. My temper
would perhaps called resentful. My good opinion lost, lost
forever."

"_That_ failing indeed!" cried Elizabeth. "Implacable resentment
_is_ shade character. But chosen fault well. I
really cannot _laugh_ it. You safe me."

"There is, I believe, every disposition tendency particular
evil--a natural defect, even best education overcome."

"And _your_ defect hate everybody."

"And yours," replied smile, "is willfully misunderstand
them."

"Do let us little music," cried Miss Bingley, tired
conversation share. "Louisa, mind
waking Mr. Hurst?"

Her sister smallest objection, pianoforte
opened; Darcy, moments' recollection, sorry
it. He began feel danger paying Elizabeth much attention.



Chapter 12


In consequence agreement sisters, Elizabeth wrote
next morning mother, beg carriage might sent
course day. But Mrs. Bennet, calculated
daughters remaining Netherfield till following Tuesday,
would exactly finish Jane's week, could bring receive
pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, propitious,
least Elizabeth's wishes, impatient get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent word could possibly carriage
Tuesday; postscript added, Mr. Bingley
sister pressed stay longer, could spare
well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth positively
resolved--nor much expect would asked; fearful,
contrary, considered intruding needlessly long,
urged Jane borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately,
length settled original design leaving Netherfield
morning mentioned, request made.

The communication excited many professions concern; enough
said wishing stay least till following day work
Jane; till morrow going deferred. Miss Bingley
sorry proposed delay, jealousy dislike
one sister much exceeded affection other.

The master house heard real sorrow go
soon, repeatedly tried persuade Miss Bennet would
safe her--that enough recovered; Jane firm
felt right.

To Mr. Darcy welcome intelligence--Elizabeth
Netherfield long enough. She attracted liked--and Miss
Bingley uncivil _her_, teasing usual himself.
He wisely resolved particularly careful sign admiration
_now_ escape him, nothing could elevate hope
influencing felicity; sensible idea
suggested, behaviour last day must material weight
confirming crushing it. Steady purpose, scarcely spoke
ten words whole Saturday, though
one time left half-an-hour, adhered
conscientiously book, would even look her.

On Sunday, morning service, separation, agreeable almost
all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility Elizabeth increased last
rapidly, well affection Jane; parted,
assuring latter pleasure would always give
see either Longbourn Netherfield, embracing
tenderly, even shook hands former. Elizabeth took leave
whole party liveliest spirits.

They welcomed home cordially mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered coming, thought wrong give much
trouble, sure Jane would caught cold again. But
father, though laconic expressions pleasure, really
glad see them; felt importance family circle. The
evening conversation, assembled, lost much
animation, almost sense absence Jane
Elizabeth.

They found Mary, usual, deep study thorough-bass human
nature; extracts admire, new observations
threadbare morality listen to. Catherine Lydia information
different sort. Much done much said
regiment since preceding Wednesday; several officers
dined lately uncle, private flogged,
actually hinted Colonel Forster going married.



Chapter 13


"I hope, dear," said Mr. Bennet wife,
breakfast next morning, "that ordered good dinner to-day,
I reason expect addition family party."

"Who mean, dear? I know nobody coming, I sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas happen call in--and I hope _my_ dinners
good enough her. I believe often sees home."

"The person I speak gentleman, stranger."

Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A gentleman stranger! It Mr.
Bingley, I sure! Well, I sure I shall extremely glad see Mr.
Bingley. But--good Lord! unlucky! There bit fish
got to-day. Lydia, love, ring bell--I must speak Hill
moment."

"It _not_ Mr. Bingley," said husband; "it person I
never saw whole course life."

This roused general astonishment; pleasure
eagerly questioned wife five daughters once.

After amusing time curiosity, thus explained:

"About month ago I received letter; fortnight ago
I answered it, I thought case delicacy, requiring
early attention. It cousin, Mr. Collins, who, I dead,
may turn house soon pleases."

"Oh! dear," cried wife, "I cannot bear hear mentioned.
Pray talk odious man. I think hardest thing
world, estate entailed away
children; I sure, I you, I tried long ago
something it."

Jane Elizabeth tried explain nature entail. They
often attempted before, subject
Mrs. Bennet beyond reach reason, continued rail
bitterly cruelty settling estate away family
five daughters, favour man nobody cared anything about.

"It certainly iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and
nothing clear Mr. Collins guilt inheriting Longbourn.
But listen letter, may perhaps little
softened manner expressing himself."

"No, I sure I shall not; I think impertinent
write all, hypocritical. I hate false
friends. Why could keep quarreling you, father
him?"

"Why, indeed; seem filial scruples
head, hear."

"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.

"Dear Sir,--

"At four o'clock, therefore, may expect peace-making gentleman,"
said Mr. Bennet, folded letter. "He seems
conscientious polite young man, upon word, I doubt
prove valuable acquaintance, especially Lady Catherine
indulgent let come us again."

"There sense says girls, however,
disposed make amends, I shall person

"Though difficult," said Jane, "to guess way mean
make us atonement thinks due, wish certainly
credit."

Elizabeth chiefly struck extraordinary deference Lady
Catherine, kind intention christening, marrying, burying
parishioners whenever required.

"He must oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make
out.--There something pompous style.--And
mean apologising next entail?--We cannot suppose
would help could.--Could sensible man, sir?"

"No, dear, I think not. I great hopes finding quite

"In point composition," said Mary, "the letter seem
defective. The idea olive-branch perhaps wholly new, yet I
think well expressed."

To Catherine Lydia, neither letter writer
degree interesting. It next impossible cousin
come scarlet coat, weeks since
received pleasure society man colour. As
mother, Mr. Collins's letter done away much ill-will,
preparing see degree composure
astonished husband daughters.

Mr. Collins punctual time, received great
politeness whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little;
ladies ready enough talk, Mr. Collins seemed neither
need encouragement, inclined silent himself. He
tall, heavy-looking young man five-and-twenty. His air grave
stately, manners formal. He long seated
complimented Mrs. Bennet fine family
daughters; said heard much beauty,
instance fame fallen short truth; added,
doubt seeing due time disposed marriage. This
gallantry much taste hearers; Mrs.
Bennet, quarreled compliments, answered readily.

"You kind, I sure; I wish heart may
prove so, else destitute enough. Things settled
oddly."

"You allude, perhaps, entail estate."

"Ah! sir, I indeed. It grievous affair poor girls,
must confess. Not I mean find fault _you_, things
I know chance world. There knowing estates
go come entailed."

"I sensible, madam, hardship fair cousins,
could say much subject, I cautious appearing
forward precipitate. But I assure young ladies I come
prepared admire them. At present I say more; but, perhaps,
better acquainted--"

He interrupted summons dinner; girls smiled
other. They objects Mr. Collins's admiration. The
hall, dining-room, furniture, examined praised;
commendation everything would touched Mrs. Bennet's
heart, mortifying supposition viewing
future property. The dinner turn highly admired;
begged know fair cousins excellency
cooking owing. But set right Mrs. Bennet,
assured asperity well able keep
good cook, daughters nothing kitchen. He
begged pardon displeased her. In softened tone declared
offended; continued apologise
quarter hour.



Chapter 14


During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke all; servants
withdrawn, thought time conversation
guest, therefore started subject expected
shine, observing seemed fortunate patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention wishes, consideration
comfort, appeared remarkable. Mr. Bennet could chosen
better. Mr. Collins eloquent praise. The subject elevated
usual solemnity manner, important aspect
protested "he never life witnessed behaviour
person rank--such affability condescension,
experienced Lady Catherine. She graciously pleased
approve discourses already honour
preaching her. She also asked twice dine Rosings,
sent Saturday before, make pool
quadrille evening. Lady Catherine reckoned proud many
people knew, _he_ never seen anything affability her.
She always spoken would gentleman;
made smallest objection joining society
neighbourhood leaving parish occasionally week
two, visit relations. She even condescended advise
marry soon could, provided chose discretion;
paid visit humble parsonage, perfectly
approved alterations making, even vouchsafed
suggest herself--some shelves closet stairs."

"That proper civil, I sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and
I dare say agreeable woman. It pity great ladies
general like her. Does live near you, sir?"

"The garden stands humble abode separated lane
Rosings Park, ladyship's residence."

"I think said widow, sir? Has family?"

"She one daughter, heiress Rosings,
extensive property."

"Ah!" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking head, "then better
many girls. And sort young lady she? Is handsome?"

"She charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine says
that, point true beauty, Miss de Bourgh far superior
handsomest sex, features marks
young lady distinguished birth. She unfortunately sickly
constitution, prevented making progress many
accomplishments could otherwise failed of, I
informed lady superintended education, still
resides them. But perfectly amiable, often condescends
drive humble abode little phaeton ponies."

"Has presented? I remember name among ladies
court."

"Her indifferent state health unhappily prevents town;
means, I told Lady Catherine one day, deprived
British court brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased
idea; may imagine I happy every occasion
offer little delicate compliments always acceptable
ladies. I observed Lady Catherine,
charming daughter seemed born duchess,
elevated rank, instead giving consequence, would adorned
her. These kind little things please ladyship,
sort attention I conceive peculiarly bound
pay."

"You judge properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and happy
possess talent flattering delicacy. May I ask
whether pleasing attentions proceed impulse
moment, result previous study?"

"They arise chiefly passing time, though I
sometimes amuse suggesting arranging little elegant
compliments may adapted ordinary occasions, I always wish
give unstudied air possible."

Mr. Bennet's expectations fully answered. His cousin absurd
hoped, listened keenest enjoyment,
maintaining time resolute composure countenance,
and, except occasional glance Elizabeth, requiring partner
pleasure.

By tea-time, however, dose enough, Mr. Bennet glad
take guest drawing-room again, and, tea over,
glad invite read aloud ladies. Mr. Collins readily
assented, book produced; but, beholding (for everything
announced circulating library), started back,
begging pardon, protested never read novels. Kitty stared
him, Lydia exclaimed. Other books produced,
deliberation chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped opened
volume, had, monotonous solemnity, read three
pages, interrupted with:

"Do know, mamma, uncle Phillips talks turning away
Richard; does, Colonel Forster hire him. My aunt told
Saturday. I shall walk Meryton to-morrow hear
it, ask Mr. Denny comes back town."

Lydia bid two eldest sisters hold tongue; Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside book, said:

"I often observed little young ladies interested books
serious stamp, though written solely benefit. It amazes
me, I confess; for, certainly, nothing advantageous
instruction. But I longer importune young cousin."

Then turning Mr. Bennet, offered antagonist
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted challenge, observing acted
wisely leaving girls trifling amusements.
Mrs. Bennet daughters apologised civilly Lydia's
interruption, promised occur again, would
resume book; Mr. Collins, assuring bore
young cousin ill-will, never resent behaviour
affront, seated another table Mr. Bennet, prepared
backgammon.



Chapter 15


Mr. Collins sensible man, deficiency nature
little assisted education society; greatest part
life spent guidance illiterate
miserly father; though belonged one universities,
merely kept necessary terms, without forming useful
acquaintance. The subjection father brought
given originally great humility manner;
good deal counteracted self-conceit weak head, living
retirement, consequential feelings early unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance recommended Lady Catherine de
Bourgh living Hunsford vacant; respect
felt high rank, veneration patroness,
mingling good opinion himself, authority
clergyman, right rector, made altogether mixture
pride obsequiousness, self-importance humility.

Having good house sufficient income, intended
marry; seeking reconciliation Longbourn family
wife view, meant choose one daughters, found
handsome amiable represented common report.
This plan amends--of atonement--for inheriting father's
estate; thought excellent one, full eligibility
suitableness, excessively generous disinterested
part.

His plan vary seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed views, established strictest notions
due seniority; first evening _she_ settled
choice. The next morning, however, made alteration;
quarter hour's tete-a-tete Mrs. Bennet breakfast,
conversation beginning parsonage-house, leading naturally
avowal hopes, mistress might found
Longbourn, produced her, amid complaisant smiles general
encouragement, caution Jane fixed on. "As
_younger_ daughters, could take upon say--she could
positively answer--but _know_ prepossession;
_eldest_ daughter, must mention--she felt incumbent
hint, likely soon engaged."

Mr. Collins change Jane Elizabeth--and soon
done--done Mrs. Bennet stirring fire. Elizabeth, equally
next Jane birth beauty, succeeded course.

Mrs. Bennet treasured hint, trusted might soon
two daughters married; man could bear speak
day high good graces.

Lydia's intention walking Meryton forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed go her; Mr. Collins attend them,
request Mr. Bennet, anxious get rid him,
library himself; thither Mr. Collins followed
breakfast; would continue, nominally engaged
one largest folios collection, really talking Mr.
Bennet, little cessation, house garden Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In library
always sure leisure tranquillity; though prepared, told
Elizabeth, meet folly conceit every room
house, used free there; civility, therefore,
prompt inviting Mr. Collins join daughters
walk; Mr. Collins, fact much better fitted walker
reader, extremely pleased close large book, go.

In pompous nothings side, civil assents
cousins, time passed till entered Meryton. The attention
younger ones longer gained him. Their eyes
immediately wandering street quest officers,
nothing less smart bonnet indeed, really new muslin
shop window, could recall them.

But attention every lady soon caught young man,
never seen before, gentlemanlike appearance, walking
another officer side way. The officer
Mr. Denny concerning whose return London Lydia came
inquire, bowed passed. All struck
stranger's air, wondered could be; Kitty Lydia,
determined possible find out, led way across street,
pretense wanting something opposite shop, fortunately
gained pavement two gentlemen, turning back,
reached spot. Mr. Denny addressed directly, entreated
permission introduce friend, Mr. Wickham, returned
day town, happy say accepted
commission corps. This exactly be;
young man wanted regimentals make completely charming.
His appearance greatly favour; best part
beauty, fine countenance, good figure, pleasing address.
The introduction followed side happy readiness
conversation--a readiness time perfectly correct
unassuming; whole party still standing talking together
agreeably, sound horses drew notice, Darcy
Bingley seen riding street. On distinguishing
ladies group, two gentlemen came directly towards them,
began usual civilities. Bingley principal spokesman,
Miss Bennet principal object. He then, said, way
Longbourn purpose inquire her. Mr. Darcy corroborated
bow, beginning determine fix eyes
Elizabeth, suddenly arrested sight
stranger, Elizabeth happening see countenance
looked other, astonishment effect meeting.
Both changed colour, one looked white, red. Mr. Wickham,
moments, touched hat--a salutation Mr. Darcy
deigned return. What could meaning it? It impossible
imagine; impossible long know.

In another minute, Mr. Bingley, without seeming noticed
passed, took leave rode friend.

Mr. Denny Mr. Wickham walked young ladies door
Mr. Phillip's house, made bows, spite Miss Lydia's
pressing entreaties come in, even spite
Mrs. Phillips's throwing parlour window loudly seconding
invitation.

Mrs. Phillips always glad see nieces; two eldest,
recent absence, particularly welcome,
eagerly expressing surprise sudden return home, which,
carriage fetched them, known nothing
about, happened see Mr. Jones's shop-boy
street, told send draughts
Netherfield Miss Bennets come away, civility
claimed towards Mr. Collins Jane's introduction him. She
received best politeness, returned
much more, apologising intrusion, without previous
acquaintance her, could help flattering himself,
however, might justified relationship young ladies
introduced notice. Mrs. Phillips quite awed
excess good breeding; contemplation one stranger soon
put end exclamations inquiries other; whom,
however, could tell nieces already knew,
Mr. Denny brought London,
lieutenant's commission ----shire. She watching
last hour, said, walked street, Mr.
Wickham appeared, Kitty Lydia would certainly continued
occupation, unluckily one passed windows except
officers, who, comparison stranger, become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows." Some dine Phillipses
next day, aunt promised make husband call Mr.
Wickham, give invitation also, family Longbourn
would come evening. This agreed to, Mrs. Phillips
protested would nice comfortable noisy game lottery
tickets, little bit hot supper afterwards. The prospect
delights cheering, parted mutual good spirits. Mr.
Collins repeated apologies quitting room, assured
unwearying civility perfectly needless.

As walked home, Elizabeth related Jane seen pass
two gentlemen; though Jane would defended either
both, appeared wrong, could explain
behaviour sister.

Mr. Collins return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet admiring
Mrs. Phillips's manners politeness. He protested that, except Lady
Catherine daughter, never seen elegant woman;
received utmost civility, even
pointedly included invitation next evening, although
utterly unknown before. Something, supposed, might
attributed connection them, yet never met
much attention whole course life.



Chapter 16


As objection made young people's engagement
aunt, Mr. Collins's scruples leaving Mr. Mrs. Bennet
single evening visit steadily resisted, coach
conveyed five cousins suitable hour Meryton;
girls pleasure hearing, entered drawing-room,
Mr. Wickham accepted uncle's invitation,
house.

When information given, taken seats, Mr.
Collins leisure look around admire, much
struck size furniture apartment, declared
might almost supposed small summer breakfast
parlour Rosings; comparison first convey much
gratification; Mrs. Phillips understood
Rosings was, proprietor--when listened
description one Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, found
chimney-piece alone cost eight hundred pounds, felt
force compliment, would hardly resented comparison
housekeeper's room.

In describing grandeur Lady Catherine mansion,
occasional digressions praise humble abode,
improvements receiving, happily employed
gentlemen joined them; found Mrs. Phillips attentive
listener, whose opinion consequence increased
heard, resolving retail among neighbours
soon could. To girls, could listen cousin,
nothing wish instrument, examine
indifferent imitations china mantelpiece,
interval waiting appeared long. It last, however.
The gentlemen approach, Mr. Wickham walked room,
Elizabeth felt neither seeing before, thinking
since, smallest degree unreasonable admiration.
The officers ----shire general creditable,
gentlemanlike set, best present party;
Mr. Wickham far beyond person, countenance, air,
walk, _they_ superior broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,
breathing port wine, followed room.

Mr. Wickham happy man towards almost every female eye
turned, Elizabeth happy woman finally seated
himself; agreeable manner immediately fell
conversation, though wet night, made feel
commonest, dullest, threadbare topic might rendered
interesting skill speaker.

With rivals notice fair Mr. Wickham
officers, Mr. Collins seemed sink insignificance; young
ladies certainly nothing; still intervals kind
listener Mrs. Phillips, watchfulness, abundantly
supplied coffee muffin. When card-tables placed,
opportunity obliging turn, sitting whist.

"I know little game present," said he, "but I shall glad
improve myself, situation life--" Mrs. Phillips
glad compliance, could wait reason.

Mr. Wickham play whist, ready delight
received table Elizabeth Lydia. At first
seemed danger Lydia's engrossing entirely,
determined talker; likewise extremely fond lottery tickets,
soon grew much interested game, eager making bets
exclaiming prizes attention anyone particular.
Allowing common demands game, Mr. Wickham therefore
leisure talk Elizabeth, willing hear
him, though chiefly wished hear could hope
told--the history acquaintance Mr. Darcy. She dared
even mention gentleman. Her curiosity, however, unexpectedly
relieved. Mr. Wickham began subject himself. He inquired far
Netherfield Meryton; and, receiving answer, asked
hesitating manner long Mr. Darcy staying there.

"About month," said Elizabeth; then, unwilling let subject
drop, added, "He man large property Derbyshire, I
understand."

"Yes," replied Mr. Wickham; "his estate noble one. A clear
ten thousand per annum. You could met person
capable giving certain information head myself,
I connected family particular manner
infancy."

Elizabeth could look surprised.

"You may well surprised, Miss Bennet, assertion,
seeing, probably might, cold manner meeting
yesterday. Are much acquainted Mr. Darcy?"

"As much I ever wish be," cried Elizabeth warmly. "I
spent four days house him, I think
disagreeable."

"I right give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as
agreeable otherwise. I qualified form one. I known
long well fair judge. It impossible _me_
impartial. But I believe opinion would general
astonish--and perhaps would express quite strongly
anywhere else. Here family."

"Upon word, I say _here_ I might say house
neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He liked
Hertfordshire. Everybody disgusted pride. You find
favourably spoken anyone."

"I cannot pretend sorry," said Wickham, short
interruption, "that man estimated beyond
deserts; _him_ I believe often happen. The
world blinded fortune consequence, frightened
high imposing manners, sees chooses seen."

"I take him, even _my_ slight acquaintance,
ill-tempered man." Wickham shook head.

"I wonder," said he, next opportunity speaking, "whether
likely country much longer."

"I know; I _heard_ nothing going away I
Netherfield. I hope plans favour ----shire
affected neighbourhood."

"Oh! no--it _me_ driven away Mr. Darcy. If _he_
wishes avoid seeing _me_, must go. We friendly terms,
always gives pain meet him, I reason
avoiding _him_ I might proclaim world, sense
great ill-usage, painful regrets
is. His father, Miss Bennet, late Mr. Darcy, one best men
ever breathed, truest friend I ever had; I never
company Mr. Darcy without grieved soul
thousand tender recollections. His behaviour
scandalous; I verily believe I could forgive anything
everything, rather disappointing hopes disgracing
memory father."

Elizabeth found interest subject increase, listened
heart; delicacy prevented inquiry.

Mr. Wickham began speak general topics, Meryton,
neighbourhood, society, appearing highly pleased
yet seen, speaking latter gentle
intelligible gallantry.

"It prospect constant society, good society," added,
"which chief inducement enter ----shire. I knew
respectable, agreeable corps, friend Denny tempted
account present quarters, great
attentions excellent acquaintances Meryton procured them.
Society, I own, necessary me. I disappointed man,
spirits bear solitude. I _must_ employment society.
A military life I intended for, circumstances
made eligible. The church _ought_ profession--I
brought church, I time
possession valuable living, pleased gentleman
speaking now."

"Indeed!"

"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed next presentation best
living gift. He godfather, excessively attached me.
I cannot justice kindness. He meant provide amply,
thought done it; living fell, given
elsewhere."

"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but could _that_ be? How could
disregarded? Why seek legal redress?"

"There informality terms bequest
give hope law. A man honour could doubted
intention, Mr. Darcy chose doubt it--or treat merely
conditional recommendation, assert I forfeited claim
extravagance, imprudence--in short anything nothing. Certain
is, living became vacant two years ago, exactly I
age hold it, given another man;
less certain it, I cannot accuse really done
anything deserve lose it. I warm, unguarded temper,
I may spoken opinion _of_ him, _to_ him, freely. I
recall nothing worse. But fact is, different sort
men, hates me."

"This quite shocking! He deserves publicly disgraced."

"Some time _will_ be--but shall _me_. Till I
forget father, I never defy expose _him_."

Elizabeth honoured feelings, thought handsomer
ever expressed them.

"But what," said she, pause, "can motive? What
induced behave cruelly?"

"A thorough, determined dislike me--a dislike I cannot
attribute measure jealousy. Had late Mr. Darcy liked
less, son might borne better; father's uncommon
attachment irritated him, I believe, early life. He
temper bear sort competition stood--the sort
preference often given me."

"I thought Mr. Darcy bad this--though I never liked
him. I thought ill him. I supposed
despising fellow-creatures general, suspect
descending malicious revenge, injustice, inhumanity
this."

After minutes' reflection, however, continued, "I _do_
remember boasting one day, Netherfield, implacability
resentments, unforgiving temper. His disposition
must dreadful."

"I trust subject," replied Wickham; "I hardly
him."

Elizabeth deep thought, time exclaimed, "To
treat manner godson, friend, favourite
father!" She could added, "A young man, too, like _you_, whose
countenance may vouch amiable"--but contented
with, "and one, too, probably companion childhood,
connected together, I think said, closest manner!"

"We born parish, within park; greatest
part youth passed together; inmates house,
sharing amusements, objects parental care. _My_
father began life profession uncle, Mr. Phillips,
appears much credit to--but gave everything
use late Mr. Darcy devoted time care
Pemberley property. He highly esteemed Mr. Darcy,
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged
greatest obligations father's active superintendence,
when, immediately father's death, Mr. Darcy gave
voluntary promise providing me, I convinced felt
much debt gratitude _him_, affection myself."

"How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable! I wonder
pride Mr. Darcy made you! If better
motive, proud dishonest--for
dishonesty I must call it."

"It _is_ wonderful," replied Wickham, "for almost actions may
traced pride; pride often best friend. It
connected nearer virtue feeling. But
none us consistent, behaviour stronger
impulses even pride."

"Can abominable pride ever done good?"

"Yes. It often led liberal generous, give money
freely, display hospitality, assist tenants, relieve
poor. Family pride, _filial_ pride--for proud
father was--have done this. Not appear disgrace family,
degenerate popular qualities, lose influence
Pemberley House, powerful motive. He also _brotherly_ pride,
which, _some_ brotherly affection, makes kind
careful guardian sister, hear generally cried
attentive best brothers."

"What sort girl Miss Darcy?"

He shook head. "I wish I could call amiable. It gives pain
speak ill Darcy. But much like brother--very,
proud. As child, affectionate pleasing, extremely fond
me; I devoted hours hours amusement. But
nothing now. She handsome girl, fifteen sixteen,
and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since father's death,
home London, lady lives her, superintends
education."

After many pauses many trials subjects, Elizabeth could
help reverting first, saying:

"I astonished intimacy Mr. Bingley! How Mr. Bingley,
seems good humour itself, is, I really believe, truly amiable,
friendship man? How suit other? Do
know Mr. Bingley?"

"Not all."

"He sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know Mr.
Darcy is."

"Probably not; Mr. Darcy please chooses. He
want abilities. He conversible companion thinks worth
while. Among equals consequence,
different man less prosperous. His
pride never deserts him; rich liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, perhaps agreeable--allowing something
fortune figure."

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, players gathered round
table Mr. Collins took station cousin
Elizabeth Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries success
made latter. It great; lost every
point; Mrs. Phillips began express concern thereupon,
assured much earnest gravity least
importance, considered money mere trifle, begged
would make uneasy.

"I know well, madam," said he, "that persons sit
card-table, must take chances things, happily I
circumstances make five shillings object. There
undoubtedly many could say same, thanks Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I removed far beyond necessity regarding
little matters."

Mr. Wickham's attention caught; observing Mr. Collins
moments, asked Elizabeth low voice whether relation
intimately acquainted family de Bourgh.

"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," replied, "has lately given
living. I hardly know Mr. Collins first introduced
notice, certainly known long."

"You know course Lady Catherine de Bourgh Lady Anne Darcy
sisters; consequently aunt present Mr. Darcy."

"No, indeed, I not. I knew nothing Lady Catherine's
connections. I never heard existence till day
yesterday."

"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, large fortune,
believed cousin unite two estates."

This information made Elizabeth smile, thought poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must attentions, vain useless
affection sister praise himself, already
self-destined another.

"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly Lady Catherine
daughter; particulars related ladyship,
I suspect gratitude misleads him, spite
patroness, arrogant, conceited woman."

"I believe great degree," replied Wickham; "I
seen many years, I well remember I never liked
her, manners dictatorial insolent. She
reputation remarkably sensible clever; I rather believe
derives part abilities rank fortune, part
authoritative manner, rest pride
nephew, chooses everyone connected
understanding first class."

Elizabeth allowed given rational account it,
continued talking together, mutual satisfaction till supper
put end cards, gave rest ladies share Mr.
Wickham's attentions. There could conversation noise
Mrs. Phillips's supper party, manners recommended
everybody. Whatever said, said well; whatever did, done
gracefully. Elizabeth went away head full him. She could
think nothing Mr. Wickham, told her,
way home; time even mention name
went, neither Lydia Mr. Collins silent. Lydia
talked incessantly lottery tickets, fish lost
fish won; Mr. Collins describing civility Mr.
Mrs. Phillips, protesting least regard losses
whist, enumerating dishes supper, repeatedly fearing
crowded cousins, say could well manage
carriage stopped Longbourn House.



Chapter 17


Elizabeth related Jane next day passed Mr.
Wickham herself. Jane listened astonishment concern;
knew believe Mr. Darcy could unworthy Mr.
Bingley's regard; yet, nature question
veracity young man amiable appearance Wickham. The
possibility endured unkindness, enough
interest tender feelings; nothing remained therefore
done, think well both, defend conduct each,
throw account accident mistake whatever could
otherwise explained.

"They both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, way
other, form idea. Interested people perhaps
misrepresented other. It is, short, impossible us
conjecture causes circumstances may alienated them,
without actual blame either side."

"Very true, indeed; now, dear Jane, got say
behalf interested people probably concerned
business? Do clear _them_ too, shall obliged think ill
somebody."

"Laugh much choose, laugh
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, consider disgraceful light
places Mr. Darcy, treating father's favourite
manner, one father promised provide for. It
impossible. No man common humanity, man value
character, could capable it. Can intimate friends
excessively deceived him? Oh! no."

"I much easily believe Mr. Bingley's imposed on,
Mr. Wickham invent history gave
last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If
so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, truth
looks."

"It difficult indeed--it distressing. One know
think."

"I beg pardon; one knows exactly think."

But Jane could think certainty one point--that Mr. Bingley,
_had_ imposed on, would much suffer affair
became public.

The two young ladies summoned shrubbery,
conversation passed, arrival persons
speaking; Mr. Bingley sisters came give personal
invitation long-expected ball Netherfield, fixed
following Tuesday. The two ladies delighted see
dear friend again, called age since met, repeatedly
asked since separation. To
rest family paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet
much possible, saying much Elizabeth, nothing
others. They soon gone again, rising seats
activity took brother surprise, hurrying
eager escape Mrs. Bennet's civilities.

The prospect Netherfield ball extremely agreeable every
female family. Mrs. Bennet chose consider given
compliment eldest daughter, particularly flattered
receiving invitation Mr. Bingley himself, instead
ceremonious card. Jane pictured happy evening
society two friends, attentions brother;
Elizabeth thought pleasure dancing great deal Mr.
Wickham, seeing confirmation everything Mr. Darcy's look
behaviour. The happiness anticipated Catherine Lydia depended
less single event, particular person, though
each, like Elizabeth, meant dance half evening Mr. Wickham,
means partner could satisfy them, ball
was, rate, ball. And even Mary could assure family
disinclination it.

"While I mornings myself," said she, "it enough--I
think sacrifice join occasionally evening engagements.
Society claims us all; I profess one
consider intervals recreation amusement desirable
everybody."

Elizabeth's spirits high occasion, though
often speak unnecessarily Mr. Collins, could help asking
whether intended accept Mr. Bingley's invitation,
did, whether would think proper join evening's
amusement; rather surprised find entertained
scruple whatever head, far dreading rebuke
either Archbishop, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, venturing
dance.

"I means opinion, I assure you," said he, "that ball
kind, given young man character, respectable people,
evil tendency; I far objecting dancing
myself, I shall hope honoured hands fair
cousins course evening; I take opportunity
soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, two first dances especially,
preference I trust cousin Jane attribute right
cause, disrespect her."

Elizabeth felt completely taken in. She fully proposed
engaged Mr. Wickham dances; Mr. Collins
instead! liveliness never worse timed. There help
it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness perforce
delayed little longer, Mr. Collins's proposal accepted
good grace could. She better pleased
gallantry idea suggested something more. It first
struck her, _she_ selected among sisters worthy
mistress Hunsford Parsonage, assisting form
quadrille table Rosings, absence eligible visitors.
The idea soon reached conviction, observed increasing
civilities toward herself, heard frequent attempt
compliment wit vivacity; though astonished
gratified effect charms, long
mother gave understand probability marriage
extremely agreeable _her_. Elizabeth, however, choose
take hint, well aware serious dispute must
consequence reply. Mr. Collins might never make offer,
till did, useless quarrel him.

If Netherfield ball prepare talk of,
younger Miss Bennets would pitiable state
time, day invitation, day ball,
succession rain prevented walking Meryton
once. No aunt, officers, news could sought after--the
shoe-roses Netherfield got proxy. Even Elizabeth might
found trial patience weather totally suspended
improvement acquaintance Mr. Wickham; nothing less
dance Tuesday, could made Friday, Saturday, Sunday,
Monday endurable Kitty Lydia.



Chapter 18


Till Elizabeth entered drawing-room Netherfield, looked
vain Mr. Wickham among cluster red coats assembled,
doubt present never occurred her. The certainty
meeting checked recollections
might unreasonably alarmed her. She dressed
usual care, prepared highest spirits conquest
remained unsubdued heart, trusting
might course evening. But instant arose
dreadful suspicion purposely omitted Mr. Darcy's
pleasure Bingleys' invitation officers; though
exactly case, absolute fact absence
pronounced friend Denny, Lydia eagerly applied,
told Wickham obliged go town business
day before, yet returned; adding, significant smile,
"I imagine business would called away now,
wanted avoid certain gentleman here."

This part intelligence, though unheard Lydia, caught
Elizabeth, and, assured Darcy less answerable
Wickham's absence first surmise just, every
feeling displeasure former sharpened immediate
disappointment, could hardly reply tolerable civility
polite inquiries directly afterwards approached make.
Attendance, forbearance, patience Darcy, injury Wickham. She
resolved sort conversation him, turned away
degree ill-humour could wholly surmount even
speaking Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.

But Elizabeth formed ill-humour; though every prospect
destroyed evening, could dwell long
spirits; told griefs Charlotte Lucas,
seen week, soon able make voluntary transition
oddities cousin, point particular
notice. The first two dances, however, brought return distress;
dances mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward solemn,
apologising instead attending, often moving wrong without
aware it, gave shame misery disagreeable
partner couple dances give. The moment release
ecstasy.

She danced next officer, refreshment talking
Wickham, hearing universally liked. When dances
over, returned Charlotte Lucas, conversation
her, found suddenly addressed Mr. Darcy took
much surprise application hand, that,
without knowing did, accepted him. He walked away
immediately, left fret want presence
mind; Charlotte tried console her:

"I dare say find agreeable."

"Heaven forbid! _That_ would greatest misfortune all! To find
man agreeable one determined hate! Do wish
evil."

When dancing recommenced, however, Darcy approached claim
hand, Charlotte could help cautioning whisper,
simpleton, allow fancy Wickham make appear unpleasant
eyes man ten times consequence. Elizabeth made
answer, took place set, amazed dignity
arrived allowed stand opposite Mr. Darcy,
reading neighbours' looks, equal amazement beholding
it. They stood time without speaking word; began
imagine silence last two dances,
first resolved break it; till suddenly fancying would
greater punishment partner oblige talk, made
slight observation dance. He replied,
silent. After pause minutes, addressed second time
with:--"It _your_ turn say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked
dance, _you_ ought make sort remark size
room, number couples."

He smiled, assured whatever wished say
said.

"Very well. That reply present. Perhaps I may
observe private balls much pleasanter public ones. But
_now_ may silent."

"Do talk rule, then, dancing?"

"Sometimes. One must speak little, know. It would look odd
entirely silent half hour together; yet advantage
_some_, conversation ought arranged, may
trouble saying little possible."

"Are consulting feelings present case,
imagine gratifying mine?"

"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I always seen great
similarity turn minds. We unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling speak, unless expect say
something amaze whole room, handed
posterity eclat proverb."

"This striking resemblance character, I sure,"
said he. "How near may _mine_, I cannot pretend say. _You_
think faithful portrait undoubtedly."

"I must decide performance."

He made answer, silent till gone
dance, asked sisters often
walk Meryton. She answered affirmative, and, unable resist
temptation, added, "When met us day,
forming new acquaintance."

The effect immediate. A deeper shade _hauteur_ overspread
features, said word, Elizabeth, though blaming
weakness, could go on. At length Darcy spoke,
constrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham blessed happy manners
may ensure _making_ friends--whether may equally capable
_retaining_ them, less certain."

"He unlucky lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
emphasis, "and manner likely suffer
life."

Darcy made answer, seemed desirous changing subject. At
moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close them, meaning pass
set side room; perceiving Mr.
Darcy, stopped bow superior courtesy compliment
dancing partner.

"I highly gratified indeed, dear sir. Such
superior dancing often seen. It evident belong
first circles. Allow say, however, fair partner
disgrace you, I must hope pleasure often repeated,
especially certain desirable event, dear Eliza (glancing
sister Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations
flow in! I appeal Mr. Darcy:--but let interrupt you, sir. You
thank detaining bewitching converse
young lady, whose bright eyes also upbraiding me."

The latter part address scarcely heard Darcy; Sir
William's allusion friend seemed strike forcibly,
eyes directed serious expression towards Bingley
Jane, dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
turned partner, said, "Sir William's interruption made
forget talking of."

"I think speaking all. Sir William could
interrupted two people room less say themselves.
We tried two three subjects already without success,
talk next I cannot imagine."

"What think books?" said he, smiling.

"Books--oh! no. I sure never read same,
feelings."

"I sorry think so; case, least
want subject. We may compare different opinions."

"No--I cannot talk books ball-room; head always full
something else."

"The _present_ always occupies scenes--does it?" said he,
look doubt.

"Yes, always," replied, without knowing said,
thoughts wandered far subject, soon afterwards appeared
suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing say, Mr. Darcy,
hardly ever forgave, resentment created
unappeasable. You cautious, I suppose, _being
created_."

"I am," said he, firm voice.

"And never allow blinded prejudice?"

"I hope not."

"It particularly incumbent never change opinion,
secure judging properly first."

"May I ask questions tend?"

"Merely illustration _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
shake gravity. "I trying make out."

"And success?"

She shook head. "I get all. I hear different
accounts puzzle exceedingly."

"I readily believe," answered gravely, "that reports may vary
greatly respect me; I could wish, Miss Bennet,
sketch character present moment, reason
fear performance would reflect credit either."

"But I take likeness now, I may never another
opportunity."

"I would means suspend pleasure yours," coldly replied.
She said more, went dance parted
silence; side dissatisfied, though equal degree,
Darcy's breast tolerably powerful feeling towards
her, soon procured pardon, directed anger
another.

They long separated, Miss Bingley came towards her,
expression civil disdain accosted her:

"So, Miss Eliza, I hear quite delighted George Wickham!
Your sister talking him, asking thousand
questions; I find young man quite forgot tell you, among
communication, son old Wickham, late
Mr. Darcy's steward. Let recommend you, however, friend,
give implicit confidence assertions; Mr. Darcy's
using ill, perfectly false; for, contrary,
always remarkably kind him, though George Wickham treated
Mr. Darcy infamous manner. I know particulars,
I know well Mr. Darcy least blame,
cannot bear hear George Wickham mentioned, though brother
thought could well avoid including invitation
officers, excessively glad find taken
way. His coming country insolent
thing, indeed, I wonder could presume it. I pity you,
Miss Eliza, discovery favourite's guilt; really,
considering descent, one could expect much better."

"His guilt descent appear account same," said
Elizabeth angrily; "for I heard accuse nothing worse
son Mr. Darcy's steward, _that_, I
assure you, informed himself."

"I beg pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away sneer.
"Excuse interference--it kindly meant."

"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth herself. "You much mistaken
expect influence paltry attack this. I see
nothing wilful ignorance malice Mr.
Darcy." She sought eldest sister, undertaken make
inquiries subject Bingley. Jane met smile
sweet complacency, glow happy expression, sufficiently
marked well satisfied occurrences evening.
Elizabeth instantly read feelings, moment solicitude
Wickham, resentment enemies, everything else, gave way
hope Jane's fairest way happiness.

"I want know," said she, countenance less smiling
sister's, "what learnt Mr. Wickham. But perhaps
pleasantly engaged think third person; case
may sure pardon."

"No," replied Jane, "I forgotten him; I nothing
satisfactory tell you. Mr. Bingley know whole
history, quite ignorant circumstances
principally offended Mr. Darcy; vouch good conduct,
probity, honour friend, perfectly convinced
Mr. Wickham deserved much less attention Mr. Darcy
received; I sorry say account well sister's,
Mr. Wickham means respectable young man. I afraid
imprudent, deserved lose Mr. Darcy's regard."

"Mr. Bingley know Mr. Wickham himself?"

"No; never saw till morning Meryton."

"This account received Mr. Darcy. I
satisfied. But say living?"

"He exactly recollect circumstances, though heard
Mr. Darcy once, believes left
_conditionally_ only."

"I doubt Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;
"but must excuse convinced assurances only. Mr.
Bingley's defense friend able one, I dare say;
since unacquainted several parts story, learnt
rest friend himself, I shall venture still think
gentlemen I before."

She changed discourse one gratifying each,
could difference sentiment. Elizabeth listened
delight happy, though modest hopes Jane entertained Mr.
Bingley's regard, said power heighten confidence
it. On joined Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
Miss Lucas; whose inquiry pleasantness last
partner scarcely replied, Mr. Collins came them,
told great exultation fortunate
make important discovery.

"I found out," said he, "by singular accident,
room near relation patroness. I happened overhear
gentleman mentioning young lady honours
house names cousin Miss de Bourgh, mother Lady
Catherine. How wonderfully sort things occur! Who would
thought meeting with, perhaps, nephew Lady Catherine de
Bourgh assembly! I thankful discovery made
time pay respects him, I going
do, trust excuse done before. My total
ignorance connection must plead apology."

"You going introduce Mr. Darcy!"

"Indeed I am. I shall entreat pardon done earlier.
I believe Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It power
assure ladyship quite well yesterday se'nnight."

Elizabeth tried hard dissuade scheme, assuring
Mr. Darcy would consider addressing without introduction
impertinent freedom, rather compliment aunt;
least necessary notice either
side; were, must belong Mr. Darcy, superior
consequence, begin acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened
determined air following inclination, and,
ceased speaking, replied thus:

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I highest opinion world
excellent judgement matters within scope
understanding; permit say, must wide
difference established forms ceremony amongst laity,
regulate clergy; for, give leave observe
I consider clerical office equal point dignity
highest rank kingdom--provided proper humility
behaviour time maintained. You must therefore allow
follow dictates conscience occasion, leads
perform I look point duty. Pardon neglecting
profit advice, every subject shall constant
guide, though case us I consider fitted
education habitual study decide right young
lady like yourself." And low bow left attack Mr.
Darcy, whose reception advances eagerly watched, whose
astonishment addressed evident. Her cousin prefaced
speech solemn bow though could hear word
it, felt hearing all, saw motion lips
words "apology," "Hunsford," "Lady Catherine de Bourgh." It vexed
see expose man. Mr. Darcy eyeing
unrestrained wonder, last Mr. Collins allowed time
speak, replied air distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,
discouraged speaking again, Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing length second speech,
end made slight bow, moved another way. Mr.
Collins returned Elizabeth.

"I reason, I assure you," said he, "to dissatisfied
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased attention. He answered
utmost civility, even paid compliment saying
well convinced Lady Catherine's discernment
certain could never bestow favour unworthily. It really
handsome thought. Upon whole, I much pleased him."

As Elizabeth longer interest pursue, turned
attention almost entirely sister Mr. Bingley;
train agreeable reflections observations gave birth to,
made perhaps almost happy Jane. She saw idea settled
house, felicity marriage true affection
could bestow; felt capable, circumstances,
endeavouring even like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts
plainly saw bent way, determined
venture near her, lest might hear much. When sat
supper, therefore, considered unlucky perverseness
placed within one other; deeply vexed find
mother talking one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, nothing else expectation Jane would soon
married Mr. Bingley. It animating subject, Mrs. Bennet
seemed incapable fatigue enumerating advantages
match. His charming young man, rich, living
three miles them, first points self-gratulation;
comfort think fond two sisters
Jane, certain must desire connection much
could do. It was, moreover, promising thing younger
daughters, Jane's marrying greatly must throw way
rich men; lastly, pleasant time life
able consign single daughters care sister,
might obliged go company liked. It
necessary make circumstance matter pleasure,
occasions etiquette; one less likely Mrs.
Bennet find comfort staying home period life. She
concluded many good wishes Lady Lucas might soon equally
fortunate, though evidently triumphantly believing
chance it.

In vain Elizabeth endeavour check rapidity mother's
words, persuade describe felicity less audible
whisper; for, inexpressible vexation, could perceive
chief overheard Mr. Darcy, sat opposite them. Her
mother scolded nonsensical.

"What Mr. Darcy me, pray, I afraid him? I
sure owe particular civility obliged say
nothing _he_ may like hear."

"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage
offend Mr. Darcy? You never recommend friend
doing!"

Nothing could say, however, influence. Her mother would
talk views intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed
blushed shame vexation. She could help frequently
glancing eye Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced
dreaded; though always looking mother,
convinced attention invariably fixed her. The expression
face changed gradually indignant contempt composed
steady gravity.

At length, however, Mrs. Bennet say; Lady Lucas,
long yawning repetition delights saw
likelihood sharing, left comforts cold ham
chicken. Elizabeth began revive. But long interval
tranquillity; for, supper over, singing talked of,
mortification seeing Mary, little entreaty,
preparing oblige company. By many significant looks silent
entreaties, endeavour prevent proof complaisance,
vain; Mary would understand them; opportunity
exhibiting delightful her, began song. Elizabeth's
eyes fixed painful sensations, watched
progress several stanzas impatience
ill rewarded close; Mary, receiving, amongst thanks
table, hint hope might prevailed
favour again, pause half minute began another.
Mary's powers means fitted display; voice
weak, manner affected. Elizabeth agonies. She looked
Jane, see bore it; Jane composedly talking
Bingley. She looked two sisters, saw making signs
derision other, Darcy, continued, however,
imperturbably grave. She looked father entreat
interference, lest Mary singing night. He took hint,
Mary finished second song, said aloud, "That
extremely well, child. You delighted us long enough. Let
young ladies time exhibit."

Mary, though pretending hear, somewhat disconcerted;
Elizabeth, sorry her, sorry father's speech, afraid
anxiety done good. Others party applied to.

"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were fortunate able sing, I
great pleasure, I sure, obliging company
air; I consider music innocent diversion, perfectly
compatible profession clergyman. I mean, however,
assert justified devoting much time
music, certainly things attended to. The
rector parish much do. In first place, must make
agreement tithes may beneficial
offensive patron. He must write sermons; time
remains much parish duties, care
improvement dwelling, cannot excused making
comfortable possible. And I think light importance
attentive conciliatory manners towards everybody,
especially towards owes preferment. I cannot acquit
duty; could I think well man omit
occasion testifying respect towards anybody connected
family." And bow Mr. Darcy, concluded speech,
spoken loud heard half room. Many stared--many
smiled; one looked amused Mr. Bennet himself,
wife seriously commended Mr. Collins spoken sensibly,
observed half-whisper Lady Lucas, remarkably
clever, good kind young man.

To Elizabeth appeared that, family made agreement
expose much could evening, would
impossible play parts spirit
finer success; happy think Bingley sister
exhibition escaped notice,
feelings sort much distressed folly
must witnessed. That two sisters Mr. Darcy, however,
opportunity ridiculing relations, bad enough,
could determine whether silent contempt
gentleman, insolent smiles ladies, intolerable.

The rest evening brought little amusement. She teased
Mr. Collins, continued perseveringly side, though
could prevail dance again, put
power dance others. In vain entreat stand
somebody else, offer introduce young lady room.
He assured her, dancing, perfectly indifferent it;
chief object delicate attentions recommend
therefore make point remaining close
whole evening. There arguing upon project. She owed
greatest relief friend Miss Lucas, often joined them,
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation herself.

She least free offense Mr. Darcy's notice;
though often standing within short distance her, quite
disengaged, never came near enough speak. She felt
probable consequence allusions Mr. Wickham, rejoiced
it.

The Longbourn party last company depart, and,
manoeuvre Mrs. Bennet, wait carriage quarter
hour everybody else gone, gave time see
heartily wished away family. Mrs. Hurst
sister scarcely opened mouths, except complain fatigue,
evidently impatient house themselves. They repulsed
every attempt Mrs. Bennet conversation, threw
languor whole party, little relieved
long speeches Mr. Collins, complimenting Mr. Bingley
sisters elegance entertainment, hospitality
politeness marked behaviour guests. Darcy said
nothing all. Mr. Bennet, equal silence, enjoying scene.
Mr. Bingley Jane standing together, little detached
rest, talked other. Elizabeth preserved steady
silence either Mrs. Hurst Miss Bingley; even Lydia
much fatigued utter occasional exclamation "Lord,
tired I am!" accompanied violent yawn.

When length arose take leave, Mrs. Bennet pressingly
civil hope seeing whole family soon Longbourn,
addressed especially Mr. Bingley, assure happy
would make eating family dinner time, without
ceremony formal invitation. Bingley grateful pleasure,
readily engaged taking earliest opportunity waiting
her, return London, whither obliged go next
day short time.

Mrs. Bennet perfectly satisfied, quitted house
delightful persuasion that, allowing necessary preparations
settlements, new carriages, wedding clothes, undoubtedly
see daughter settled Netherfield course three four
months. Of another daughter married Mr. Collins, thought
equal certainty, considerable, though equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth least dear children; though
man match quite good enough _her_, worth
eclipsed Mr. Bingley Netherfield.



Chapter 19


The next day opened new scene Longbourn. Mr. Collins made
declaration form. Having resolved without loss time,
leave absence extended following Saturday,
feelings diffidence make distressing even
moment, set orderly manner,
observances, supposed regular part business. On
finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, one younger girls together,
soon breakfast, addressed mother words:

"May I hope, madam, interest fair daughter Elizabeth,
I solicit honour private audience
course morning?"

Before Elizabeth time anything blush surprise, Mrs.
Bennet answered instantly, "Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I sure Lizzy
happy--I sure objection. Come, Kitty, I
want stairs." And, gathering work together, hastening
away, Elizabeth called out:

"Dear madam, go. I beg go. Mr. Collins must excuse
me. He nothing say anybody need hear. I
going away myself."

"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire stay are." And upon
Elizabeth's seeming really, vexed embarrassed looks,
escape, added: "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon staying hearing Mr.
Collins."

Elizabeth would oppose injunction--and moment's
consideration making also sensible would wisest get
soon quietly possible, sat tried
conceal, incessant employment feelings divided
distress diversion. Mrs. Bennet Kitty walked off, soon
gone, Mr. Collins began.

"Believe me, dear Miss Elizabeth, modesty, far
disservice, rather adds perfections. You
would less amiable eyes _not_ little
unwillingness; allow assure you, I respected
mother's permission address. You hardly doubt
purport discourse, however natural delicacy may lead
dissemble; attentions marked mistaken. Almost
soon I entered house, I singled companion
future life. But I run away feelings
subject, perhaps would advisable state reasons
marrying--and, moreover, coming Hertfordshire design
selecting wife, I certainly did."

The idea Mr. Collins, solemn composure, run away
feelings, made Elizabeth near laughing, could
use short pause allowed attempt stop further,
continued:

"My reasons marrying are, first, I think right thing
every clergyman easy circumstances (like myself) set example
matrimony parish; secondly, I convinced
add greatly happiness; thirdly--which perhaps I ought
mentioned earlier, particular advice
recommendation noble lady I honour calling
patroness. Twice condescended give opinion (unasked
too!) subject; Saturday night I
left Hunsford--between pools quadrille, Mrs. Jenkinson
arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, said, 'Mr. Collins,
must marry. A clergyman like must marry. Choose properly, choose
gentlewoman _my_ sake; _own_, let active,
useful sort person, brought high, able make small
income go good way. This advice. Find woman soon
can, bring Hunsford, I visit her.' Allow me,
way, observe, fair cousin, I reckon notice
kindness Lady Catherine de Bourgh among least
advantages power offer. You find manners beyond
anything I describe; wit vivacity, I think, must
acceptable her, especially tempered silence
respect rank inevitably excite. Thus much general
intention favour matrimony; remains told views
directed towards Longbourn instead neighbourhood, I
assure many amiable young women. But fact is,
being, I am, inherit estate death honoured
father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could satisfy
without resolving choose wife among daughters,
loss might little possible, melancholy
event takes place--which, however, I already said, may
several years. This motive, fair cousin,
I flatter sink esteem. And nothing
remains assure animated language
violence affection. To fortune I perfectly indifferent,
shall make demand nature father, since I well
aware could complied with; one thousand pounds
four per cents, till mother's
decease, may ever entitled to. On head,
therefore, I shall uniformly silent; may assure
ungenerous reproach shall ever pass lips married."

It absolutely necessary interrupt now.

"You hasty, sir," cried. "You forget I made
answer. Let without loss time. Accept thanks
compliment paying me. I sensible honour
proposals, impossible otherwise
decline them."

"I learn," replied Mr. Collins, formal wave
hand, "that usual young ladies reject addresses
man secretly mean accept, first applies
favour; sometimes refusal repeated second, even
third time. I therefore means discouraged
said, shall hope lead altar ere long."

"Upon word, sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope rather
extraordinary one declaration. I assure I
one young ladies (if young ladies are)
daring risk happiness chance asked second
time. I perfectly serious refusal. You could make _me_
happy, I convinced I last woman world
could make so. Nay, friend Lady Catherine know me, I
persuaded would find every respect ill qualified
situation."

"Were certain Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins
gravely--"but I cannot imagine ladyship would
disapprove you. And may certain I honour
seeing again, I shall speak highest terms
modesty, economy, amiable qualification."

"Indeed, Mr. Collins, praise unnecessary. You
must give leave judge myself, pay compliment
believing I say. I wish happy rich,
refusing hand, power prevent otherwise.
In making offer, must satisfied delicacy
feelings regard family, may take possession Longbourn
estate whenever falls, without self-reproach. This matter may
considered, therefore, finally settled." And rising
thus spoke, would quitted room, Mr. Collins thus
addressed her:

"When I honour speaking next subject, I
shall hope receive favourable answer given
me; though I far accusing cruelty present, I
know established custom sex reject man
first application, perhaps even said much
encourage suit would consistent true delicacy
female character."

"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth warmth, "you puzzle
exceedingly. If I hitherto said appear form
encouragement, I know express refusal way
convince one."

"You must give leave flatter myself, dear cousin,
refusal addresses merely words course. My reasons
believing briefly these: It appear hand
unworthy acceptance, establishment I offer would
highly desirable. My situation life, connections
family de Bourgh, relationship own,
circumstances highly favour; take
consideration, spite manifold attractions,
means certain another offer marriage may ever made you. Your
portion unhappily small likelihood undo
effects loveliness amiable qualifications. As I must
therefore conclude serious rejection me,
I shall choose attribute wish increasing love
suspense, according usual practice elegant females."

"I assure you, sir, I pretensions whatever kind
elegance consists tormenting respectable man. I would
rather paid compliment believed sincere. I thank
honour done proposals,
accept absolutely impossible. My feelings every respect
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do consider elegant
female, intending plague you, rational creature, speaking
truth heart."

"You uniformly charming!" cried he, air awkward
gallantry; "and I persuaded sanctioned express
authority excellent parents, proposals fail
acceptable."

To perseverance wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make
reply, immediately silence withdrew; determined,
persisted considering repeated refusals flattering
encouragement, apply father, whose negative might uttered
manner decisive, whose behaviour least could
mistaken affectation coquetry elegant female.



Chapter 20


Mr. Collins left long silent contemplation
successful love; Mrs. Bennet, dawdled vestibule
watch end conference, sooner saw Elizabeth open
door quick step pass towards staircase,
entered breakfast-room, congratulated
warm terms happy prospect nearer connection. Mr. Collins
received returned felicitations equal pleasure,
proceeded relate particulars interview, result
trusted every reason satisfied, since
refusal cousin steadfastly given would naturally flow
bashful modesty genuine delicacy character.

This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; would
glad equally satisfied daughter meant encourage
protesting proposals, dared believe it,
could help saying so.

"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins," added, "that Lizzy shall
brought reason. I speak directly. She
headstrong, foolish girl, know interest I
_make_ know it."

"Pardon interrupting you, madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but
really headstrong foolish, I know whether would
altogether desirable wife man situation,
naturally looks happiness marriage state. If therefore
actually persists rejecting suit, perhaps better
force accepting me, liable defects
temper, could contribute much felicity."

"Sir, quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. "Lizzy
headstrong matters these. In everything else
good-natured girl ever lived. I go directly Mr. Bennet,
shall soon settle her, I sure."

She would give time reply, hurrying instantly
husband, called entered library, "Oh! Mr. Bennet,
wanted immediately; uproar. You must come make
Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, vows him,
make haste change mind _her_."

Mr. Bennet raised eyes book entered, fixed
face calm unconcern least altered
communication.

"I pleasure understanding you," said he,
finished speech. "Of talking?"

"Of Mr. Collins Lizzy. Lizzy declares Mr. Collins,
Mr. Collins begins say Lizzy."

"And I occasion? It seems hopeless business."

"Speak Lizzy yourself. Tell insist upon
marrying him."

"Let called down. She shall hear opinion."

Mrs. Bennet rang bell, Miss Elizabeth summoned
library.

"Come here, child," cried father appeared. "I sent
affair importance. I understand Mr. Collins made
offer marriage. Is true?" Elizabeth replied was.
"Very well--and offer marriage refused?"

"I have, sir."

"Very well. We come point. Your mother insists upon
accepting it. Is so, Mrs. Bennet?"

"Yes, I never see again."

"An unhappy alternative you, Elizabeth. From day must
stranger one parents. Your mother never see
_not_ marry Mr. Collins, I never see
_do_."

Elizabeth could smile conclusion beginning,
Mrs. Bennet, persuaded husband regarded
affair wished, excessively disappointed.

"What mean, Mr. Bennet, talking way? You promised
_insist_ upon marrying him."

"My dear," replied husband, "I two small favours request.
First, allow free use understanding
present occasion; secondly, room. I shall glad
library soon may be."

Not yet, however, spite disappointment husband,
Mrs. Bennet give point. She talked Elizabeth again;
coaxed threatened turns. She endeavoured secure Jane
interest; Jane, possible mildness, declined
interfering; Elizabeth, sometimes real earnestness,
sometimes playful gaiety, replied attacks. Though manner
varied, however, determination never did.

Mr. Collins, meanwhile, meditating solitude passed.
He thought well comprehend motives cousin
could refuse him; though pride hurt, suffered
way. His regard quite imaginary; possibility
deserving mother's reproach prevented feeling regret.

While family confusion, Charlotte Lucas came spend
day them. She met vestibule Lydia, who, flying
her, cried half whisper, "I glad come,
fun here! What think happened morning? Mr. Collins
made offer Lizzy, him."

Charlotte hardly time answer, joined Kitty,
came tell news; sooner entered
breakfast-room, Mrs. Bennet alone, likewise began
subject, calling Miss Lucas compassion, entreating
persuade friend Lizzy comply wishes
family. "Pray do, dear Miss Lucas," added melancholy tone,
"for nobody side, nobody takes part me. I cruelly used,
nobody feels poor nerves."

Charlotte's reply spared entrance Jane Elizabeth.

"Aye, comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking unconcerned
may be, caring us York, provided
way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if take
head go refusing every offer marriage way,
never get husband all--and I sure I know
maintain father dead. I shall able keep
you--and I warn you. I done day. I told
library, know, I never speak again,
find good word. I pleasure talking
undutiful children. Not I much pleasure, indeed, talking
anybody. People suffer I nervous complaints
great inclination talking. Nobody tell I suffer! But
always so. Those complain never pitied."

Her daughters listened silence effusion, sensible
attempt reason soothe would increase
irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption
them, till joined Mr. Collins, entered room
air stately usual, perceiving whom, said
girls, "Now, I insist upon it, you, you, hold
tongues, let Mr. Collins little conversation
together."

Elizabeth passed quietly room, Jane Kitty followed,
Lydia stood ground, determined hear could; Charlotte,
detained first civility Mr. Collins, whose inquiries
family minute, little
curiosity, satisfied walking window pretending
hear. In doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began projected
conversation: "Oh! Mr. Collins!"

"My dear madam," replied he, "let us ever silent point.
Far me," presently continued, voice marked
displeasure, "to resent behaviour daughter. Resignation
inevitable evils duty us all; peculiar duty
young man fortunate I early preferment;
I trust I resigned. Perhaps less feeling doubt
positive happiness fair cousin honoured hand;
I often observed resignation never perfect
blessing denied begins lose somewhat value
estimation. You not, I hope, consider showing disrespect
family, dear madam, thus withdrawing pretensions
daughter's favour, without paid Mr. Bennet
compliment requesting interpose authority
behalf. My conduct may, I fear, objectionable accepted
dismission daughter's lips instead own. But
liable error. I certainly meant well whole affair.
My object secure amiable companion myself, due
consideration advantage family, _manner_
reprehensible, I beg leave apologise."



Chapter 21


The discussion Mr. Collins's offer nearly end,
Elizabeth suffer uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, occasionally peevish allusions
mother. As gentleman himself, _his_ feelings chiefly
expressed, embarrassment dejection, trying avoid her,
stiffness manner resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke
her, assiduous attentions sensible
transferred rest day Miss Lucas, whose
civility listening seasonable relief all,
especially friend.

The morrow produced abatement Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour ill
health. Mr. Collins also state angry pride. Elizabeth
hoped resentment might shorten visit, plan
appear least affected it. He always gone
Saturday, Saturday meant stay.

After breakfast, girls walked Meryton inquire Mr. Wickham
returned, lament absence Netherfield ball.
He joined entering town, attended
aunt's regret vexation, concern everybody,
well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, voluntarily acknowledged
necessity absence _had_ self-imposed.

"I found," said he, "as time drew near I better meet
Mr. Darcy; room, party
many hours together, might I could bear, scenes
might arise unpleasant myself."

She highly approved forbearance, leisure full
discussion it, commendation civilly
bestowed other, Wickham another officer walked back
Longbourn, walk particularly attended
her. His accompanying double advantage; felt
compliment offered herself, acceptable
occasion introducing father mother.

Soon return, letter delivered Miss Bennet; came
Netherfield. The envelope contained sheet elegant, little,
hot-pressed paper, well covered lady's fair, flowing hand;
Elizabeth saw sister's countenance change read it, saw
dwelling intently particular passages. Jane recollected
soon, putting letter away, tried join usual
cheerfulness general conversation; Elizabeth felt anxiety
subject drew attention even Wickham;
sooner companion taken leave, glance Jane
invited follow stairs. When gained room,
Jane, taking letter, said:

"This Caroline Bingley; contains surprised good
deal. The whole party left Netherfield time,
way town--and without intention coming back again. You
shall hear says."

She read first sentence aloud, comprised information
resolved follow brother town directly,
meaning dine Grosvenor Street, Mr. Hurst
house. The next words: "I pretend regret anything
I shall leave Hertfordshire, except society, dearest friend;
hope, future period, enjoy many returns
delightful intercourse known, meanwhile may
lessen pain separation frequent unreserved
correspondence. I depend that." To highflown
expressions Elizabeth listened insensibility distrust;
though suddenness removal surprised her, saw
nothing really lament; supposed
absence Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's there;
loss society, persuaded Jane must cease
regard it, enjoyment his.

"It unlucky," said she, short pause, "that
able see friends leave country. But may
hope period future happiness Miss Bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier aware, delightful
intercourse known friends renewed yet greater
satisfaction sisters? Mr. Bingley detained London
them."

"Caroline decidedly says none party return
Hertfordshire winter. I read you:"

"When brother left us yesterday, imagined business
took London might concluded three four days;
certain cannot so, time convinced
Charles gets town hurry leave again,
determined following thither, may obliged spend
vacant hours comfortless hotel. Many acquaintances
already winter; I wish I could hear you,
dearest friend, intention making one crowd--but
I despair. I sincerely hope Christmas Hertfordshire may
abound gaieties season generally brings,
beaux numerous prevent feeling loss
three shall deprive you."

"It evident this," added Jane, "that comes back
winter."

"It evident Miss Bingley mean _should_."

"Why think so? It must doing. He
master. But know _all_. I _will_ read passage
particularly hurts me. I reserves _you_."

"Mr. Darcy impatient see sister; and, confess truth,
_we_ scarcely less eager meet again. I really think
Georgiana Darcy equal beauty, elegance, accomplishments;
affection inspires Louisa heightened
something still interesting, hope dare entertain
hereafter sister. I know whether I ever
mentioned feelings subject; I leave
country without confiding them, I trust esteem
unreasonable. My brother admires greatly already;
frequent opportunity seeing intimate footing;
relations wish connection much own; sister's
partiality misleading me, I think, I call Charles
capable engaging woman's heart. With circumstances
favour attachment, nothing prevent it, I wrong, dearest
Jane, indulging hope event secure happiness
many?"

"What think _this_ sentence, dear Lizzy?" said Jane
finished it. "Is clear enough? Does expressly declare
Caroline neither expects wishes sister;
perfectly convinced brother's indifference;
suspects nature feelings him, means (most kindly!)
put guard? Can opinion subject?"

"Yes, can; mine totally different. Will hear it?"

"Most willingly."

"You shall words. Miss Bingley sees brother
love you, wants marry Miss Darcy. She follows
town hope keeping there, tries persuade
care you."

Jane shook head.

"Indeed, Jane, ought believe me. No one ever seen
together doubt affection. Miss Bingley, I sure, cannot. She
simpleton. Could seen half much love Mr.
Darcy herself, would ordered wedding clothes. But
case this: We rich enough grand enough them;
anxious get Miss Darcy brother, notion
_one_ intermarriage, may less trouble
achieving second; certainly ingenuity,
I dare say would succeed, Miss de Bourgh way. But,
dearest Jane, cannot seriously imagine Miss Bingley
tells brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, smallest
degree less sensible _your_ merit took leave
Tuesday, power persuade that, instead
love you, much love friend."

"If thought alike Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation might make quite easy. But I know
foundation unjust. Caroline incapable wilfully deceiving
anyone; I hope case deceiving
herself."

"That right. You could started happy idea, since
take comfort mine. Believe deceived, means.
You done duty her, must fret longer."

"But, dear sister, I happy, even supposing best,
accepting man whose sisters friends wishing marry
elsewhere?"

"You must decide yourself," said Elizabeth; "and if, upon mature
deliberation, find misery disobliging two sisters
equivalent happiness wife, I advise
means refuse him."

"How talk so?" said Jane, faintly smiling. "You must know
though I exceedingly grieved disapprobation, I could
hesitate."

"I think would; case, I cannot consider
situation much compassion."

"But returns winter, choice never
required. A thousand things may arise six months!"

The idea returning Elizabeth treated utmost
contempt. It appeared merely suggestion Caroline's
interested wishes, could moment suppose
wishes, however openly artfully spoken, could influence young man
totally independent everyone.

She represented sister forcibly possible felt
subject, soon pleasure seeing happy effect.
Jane's temper desponding, gradually led hope,
though diffidence affection sometimes overcame hope,
Bingley would return Netherfield answer every wish heart.

They agreed Mrs. Bennet hear departure
family, without alarmed score gentleman's conduct;
even partial communication gave great deal concern,
bewailed exceedingly unlucky ladies happen
go away getting intimate together. After
lamenting it, however, length, consolation Mr.
Bingley would soon soon dining Longbourn,
conclusion comfortable declaration, though
invited family dinner, would take care two
full courses.



Chapter 22


The Bennets engaged dine Lucases
chief day Miss Lucas kind listen Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth took opportunity thanking her. "It keeps good
humour," said she, "and I obliged I express."
Charlotte assured friend satisfaction useful,
amply repaid little sacrifice time. This
amiable, Charlotte's kindness extended farther Elizabeth
conception of; object nothing else secure
return Mr. Collins's addresses, engaging towards
herself. Such Miss Lucas's scheme; appearances
favourable, parted night, would felt almost
secure success leave Hertfordshire
soon. But injustice fire independence
character, led escape Longbourn House next
morning admirable slyness, hasten Lucas Lodge throw
feet. He anxious avoid notice cousins,
conviction saw depart, could fail
conjecture design, willing attempt known
till success might known likewise; though feeling almost
secure, reason, Charlotte tolerably encouraging,
comparatively diffident since adventure Wednesday.
His reception, however, flattering kind. Miss Lucas
perceived upper window walked towards house,
instantly set meet accidentally lane. But little
dared hope much love eloquence awaited there.

In short time Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,
everything settled satisfaction both;
entered house earnestly entreated name day
make happiest men; though solicitation must
waived present, lady felt inclination trifle
happiness. The stupidity favoured nature must
guard courtship charm could make woman wish
continuance; Miss Lucas, accepted solely pure
disinterested desire establishment, cared soon
establishment gained.

Sir William Lady Lucas speedily applied consent;
bestowed joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present
circumstances made eligible match daughter,
could give little fortune; prospects future wealth
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly calculate,
interest matter ever excited before, many years longer
Mr. Bennet likely live; Sir William gave decided
opinion, whenever Mr. Collins possession
Longbourn estate, would highly expedient wife
make appearance St. James's. The whole family, short,
properly overjoyed occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
_coming out_ year two sooner might otherwise
done; boys relieved apprehension Charlotte's
dying old maid. Charlotte tolerably composed. She
gained point, time consider it. Her reflections
general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, sure, neither sensible
agreeable; society irksome, attachment must
imaginary. But still would husband. Without thinking highly
either men matrimony, marriage always object;
provision well-educated young women small fortune,
however uncertain giving happiness, must pleasantest
preservative want. This preservative obtained;
age twenty-seven, without ever handsome, felt
good luck it. The least agreeable circumstance business
surprise must occasion Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship
valued beyond person. Elizabeth would wonder,
probably would blame her; though resolution
shaken, feelings must hurt disapprobation. She resolved
give information herself, therefore charged Mr. Collins,
returned Longbourn dinner, drop hint
passed family. A promise secrecy course
dutifully given, could kept without difficulty;
curiosity excited long absence burst forth direct
questions return required ingenuity evade,
time exercising great self-denial, longing
publish prosperous love.

As begin journey early morrow see
family, ceremony leave-taking performed ladies moved
night; Mrs. Bennet, great politeness cordiality,
said happy see Longbourn again, whenever
engagements might allow visit them.

"My dear madam," replied, "this invitation particularly
gratifying, I hoping receive;
may certain I shall avail soon
possible."

They astonished; Mr. Bennet, could means wish
speedy return, immediately said:

"But danger Lady Catherine's disapprobation here,
good sir? You better neglect relations run risk
offending patroness."

"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I particularly obliged
friendly caution, may depend upon taking
material step without ladyship's concurrence."

"You cannot much upon guard. Risk anything rather
displeasure; find likely raised coming us
again, I think exceedingly probable, stay quietly home,
satisfied _we_ shall take offence."

"Believe me, dear sir, gratitude warmly excited
affectionate attention; depend upon it, speedily receive
letter thanks this, every mark
regard stay Hertfordshire. As fair cousins, though
absence may long enough render necessary, I shall
take liberty wishing health happiness, excepting
cousin Elizabeth."

With proper civilities ladies withdrew; equally
surprised meditated quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished
understand thought paying addresses one
younger girls, Mary might prevailed accept him.
She rated abilities much higher others;
solidity reflections often struck her, though
means clever herself, thought encouraged read
improve example hers, might become
agreeable companion. But following morning, every hope
kind done away. Miss Lucas called soon breakfast,
private conference Elizabeth related event day before.

The possibility Mr. Collins's fancying love
friend occurred Elizabeth within last day two;
Charlotte could encourage seemed almost far
possibility could encourage herself, astonishment
consequently great overcome first bounds decorum,
could help crying out:

"Engaged Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!"

The steady countenance Miss Lucas commanded telling
story, gave way momentary confusion receiving direct
reproach; though, expected, soon regained
composure, calmly replied:

"Why surprised, dear Eliza? Do think incredible
Mr. Collins able procure woman's good opinion,
happy succeed you?"

But Elizabeth recollected herself, making strong effort
it, able assure tolerable firmness prospect
relationship highly grateful her, wished
imaginable happiness.

"I see feeling," replied Charlotte. "You must surprised,
much surprised--so lately Mr. Collins wishing marry
you. But time think over, I hope
satisfied I done. I romantic, know; I never
was. I ask comfortable home; considering Mr. Collins's
character, connection, situation life, I convinced
chance happiness fair people boast
entering marriage state."

Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" awkward pause,
returned rest family. Charlotte stay much
longer, Elizabeth left reflect heard.
It long time became reconciled idea
unsuitable match. The strangeness Mr. Collins's making two offers
marriage within three days nothing comparison
accepted. She always felt Charlotte's opinion matrimony
exactly like own, supposed possible
that, called action, would sacrificed every better
feeling worldly advantage. Charlotte wife Mr. Collins
humiliating picture! And pang friend disgracing
sunk esteem, added distressing conviction
impossible friend tolerably happy lot
chosen.



Chapter 23


Elizabeth sitting mother sisters, reflecting
heard, doubting whether authorised mention
it, Sir William Lucas appeared, sent daughter,
announce engagement family. With many compliments them,
much self-gratulation prospect connection
houses, unfolded matter--to audience merely wondering,
incredulous; Mrs. Bennet, perseverance politeness,
protested must entirely mistaken; Lydia, always unguarded
often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:

"Good Lord! Sir William, tell story? Do know
Mr. Collins wants marry Lizzy?"

Nothing less complaisance courtier could borne
without anger treatment; Sir William's good breeding carried
all; though begged leave positive
truth information, listened impertinence
forbearing courtesy.

Elizabeth, feeling incumbent relieve unpleasant
situation, put forward confirm account,
mentioning prior knowledge Charlotte herself;
endeavoured put stop exclamations mother sisters
earnestness congratulations Sir William,
readily joined Jane, making variety remarks
happiness might expected match, excellent character
Mr. Collins, convenient distance Hunsford London.

Mrs. Bennet fact much overpowered say great deal
Sir William remained; sooner left feelings
found rapid vent. In first place, persisted disbelieving
whole matter; secondly, sure Mr. Collins
taken in; thirdly, trusted would never
happy together; fourthly, match might broken off. Two
inferences, however, plainly deduced whole: one,
Elizabeth real cause mischief;
barbarously misused all; two
points principally dwelt rest day. Nothing could
console nothing could appease her. Nor day wear
resentment. A week elapsed could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, month passed away could speak Sir William
Lady Lucas without rude, many months gone
could forgive daughter.

Mr. Bennet's emotions much tranquil occasion,
experience pronounced agreeable sort;
gratified him, said, discover Charlotte Lucas,
used think tolerably sensible, foolish wife,
foolish daughter!

Jane confessed little surprised match; said
less astonishment earnest desire happiness;
could Elizabeth persuade consider improbable. Kitty
Lydia far envying Miss Lucas, Mr. Collins
clergyman; affected way piece news
spread Meryton.

Lady Lucas could insensible triumph able retort
Mrs. Bennet comfort daughter well married;
called Longbourn rather oftener usual say happy was,
though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks ill-natured remarks might
enough drive happiness away.

Between Elizabeth Charlotte restraint kept
mutually silent subject; Elizabeth felt persuaded
real confidence could ever subsist again. Her
disappointment Charlotte made turn fonder regard
sister, whose rectitude delicacy sure opinion could
never shaken, whose happiness grew daily anxious,
Bingley gone week nothing heard
return.

Jane sent Caroline early answer letter, counting
days till might reasonably hope hear again. The promised
letter thanks Mr. Collins arrived Tuesday, addressed
father, written solemnity gratitude
twelvemonth's abode family might prompted. After discharging
conscience head, proceeded inform them, many
rapturous expressions, happiness obtained affection
amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, explained
merely view enjoying society ready
close kind wish seeing Longbourn, whither
hoped able return Monday fortnight; Lady Catherine,
added, heartily approved marriage, wished take
place soon possible, trusted would unanswerable
argument amiable Charlotte name early day making
happiest men.

Mr. Collins's return Hertfordshire longer matter
pleasure Mrs. Bennet. On contrary, much disposed
complain husband. It strange come
Longbourn instead Lucas Lodge; also inconvenient
exceedingly troublesome. She hated visitors house
health indifferent, lovers people
disagreeable. Such gentle murmurs Mrs. Bennet,
gave way greater distress Mr. Bingley's continued
absence.

Neither Jane Elizabeth comfortable subject. Day
day passed away without bringing tidings
report shortly prevailed Meryton coming
Netherfield whole winter; report highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, never failed contradict scandalous
falsehood.

Even Elizabeth began fear--not Bingley indifferent--but
sisters would successful keeping away. Unwilling
admit idea destructive Jane's happiness,
dishonorable stability lover, could prevent
frequently occurring. The united efforts two unfeeling sisters
overpowering friend, assisted attractions Miss
Darcy amusements London might much, feared,
strength attachment.

As Jane, _her_ anxiety suspense was, course,
painful Elizabeth's, whatever felt desirous
concealing, Elizabeth, therefore, subject
never alluded to. But delicacy restrained mother,
hour seldom passed talk Bingley, express
impatience arrival, even require Jane confess
come back would think ill used. It needed
Jane's steady mildness bear attacks tolerable
tranquillity.

Mr. Collins returned punctually Monday fortnight,
reception Longbourn quite gracious
first introduction. He happy, however, need much attention;
luckily others, business love-making relieved
great deal company. The chief every day spent
Lucas Lodge, sometimes returned Longbourn time
make apology absence family went bed.

Mrs. Bennet really pitiable state. The mention
anything concerning match threw agony ill-humour,
wherever went sure hearing talked of. The sight
Miss Lucas odious her. As successor house,
regarded jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came see
them, concluded anticipating hour possession;
whenever spoke low voice Mr. Collins, convinced
talking Longbourn estate, resolving turn
daughters house, soon Mr. Bennet dead. She
complained bitterly husband.

"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it hard think Charlotte
Lucas ever mistress house, I forced
make way _her_, live see take place it!"

"My dear, give way gloomy thoughts. Let us hope
better things. Let us flatter I may survivor."

This consoling Mrs. Bennet, therefore, instead
making answer, went before.

"I cannot bear think estate. If
entail, I mind it."

"What mind?"

"I mind anything all."

"Let us thankful preserved state
insensibility."

"I never thankful, Mr. Bennet, anything entail. How
anyone could conscience entail away estate one's
daughters, I cannot understand; sake Mr. Collins too!
Why _he_ anybody else?"

"I leave determine," said Mr. Bennet.



Chapter 24


Miss Bingley's letter arrived, put end doubt. The first
sentence conveyed assurance settled London
winter, concluded brother's regret
time pay respects friends Hertfordshire left
country.

Hope over, entirely over; Jane could attend rest
letter, found little, except professed affection
writer, could give comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied
chief it. Her many attractions dwelt on, Caroline
boasted joyfully increasing intimacy, ventured predict
accomplishment wishes unfolded former
letter. She wrote also great pleasure brother's
inmate Mr. Darcy's house, mentioned raptures plans
latter regard new furniture.

Elizabeth, Jane soon communicated chief this,
heard silent indignation. Her heart divided concern
sister, resentment others. To Caroline's
assertion brother's partial Miss Darcy paid
credit. That really fond Jane, doubted
ever done; much always disposed like him,
could think without anger, hardly without contempt, easiness
temper, want proper resolution, made slave
designing friends, led sacrifice happiness
caprice inclination. Had happiness, however,
sacrifice, might allowed sport
whatever manner thought best, sister's involved it,
thought must sensible himself. It subject, short,
reflection would long indulged, must unavailing. She
could think nothing else; yet whether Bingley's regard really
died away, suppressed friends' interference; whether
aware Jane's attachment, whether escaped
observation; whatever case, though opinion must
materially affected difference, sister's situation remained
same, peace equally wounded.

A day two passed Jane courage speak feelings
Elizabeth; last, Mrs. Bennet's leaving together,
longer irritation usual Netherfield master, could
help saying:

"Oh, dear mother command herself! She
idea pain gives continual reflections him. But
I repine. It cannot last long. He forgot, shall
before."

Elizabeth looked sister incredulous solicitude, said
nothing.

"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed,
reason. He may live memory amiable man
acquaintance, all. I nothing either hope fear,
nothing reproach with. Thank God! I _that_ pain. A
little time, therefore--I shall certainly try get better."

With stronger voice soon added, "I comfort immediately,
error fancy side,
done harm anyone myself."

"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you good. Your sweetness
disinterestedness really angelic; I know say
you. I feel I never done justice, loved
deserve."

Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed extraordinary merit, threw back
praise sister's warm affection.

"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this fair. _You_ wish think
world respectable, hurt I speak ill anybody. I want
think _you_ perfect, set it. Do
afraid running excess, encroaching
privilege universal good-will. You need not. There people
I really love, still fewer I think well. The I see
world, I dissatisfied it; every day confirms
belief inconsistency human characters,
little dependence placed appearance merit
sense. I met two instances lately, one I mention;
Charlotte's marriage. It unaccountable! In every view
unaccountable!"

"My dear Lizzy, give way feelings these. They
ruin happiness. You make allowance enough difference
situation temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability,
Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember one
large family; fortune, eligible match;
ready believe, everybody's sake, may feel something like
regard esteem cousin."

"To oblige you, I would try believe almost anything, one else
could benefited belief this; I persuaded
Charlotte regard him, I think worse
understanding I heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; know is, well
I do; must feel, well I do, woman married
cannot proper way thinking. You shall defend her, though
Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, sake one individual,
change meaning principle integrity, endeavour persuade
me, selfishness prudence, insensibility
danger security happiness."

"I must think language strong speaking both," replied
Jane; "and I hope convinced seeing happy
together. But enough this. You alluded something else. You
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, I entreat
you, dear Lizzy, pain thinking _that person_ blame,
saying opinion sunk. We must ready fancy
intentionally injured. We must expect lively young man
always guarded circumspect. It often nothing
vanity deceives us. Women fancy admiration means
does."

"And men take care should."

"If designedly done, cannot justified; I idea
much design world persons imagine."

"I far attributing part Mr. Bingley's conduct design,"
said Elizabeth; "but without scheming wrong, make others
unhappy, may error, may misery. Thoughtlessness,
want attention people's feelings, want resolution,
business."

"And impute either those?"

"Yes; last. But I go on, I shall displease saying
I think persons esteem. Stop whilst can."

"You persist, then, supposing sisters influence him?"

"Yes, conjunction friend."

"I cannot believe it. Why try influence him? They
wish happiness; attached me, woman
secure it."

"Your first position false. They may wish many things besides
happiness; may wish increase wealth consequence;
may wish marry girl importance money, great
connections, pride."

"Beyond doubt, _do_ wish choose Miss Darcy," replied Jane;
"but may better feelings supposing. They
known much longer known me; wonder love
better. But, whatever may wishes, unlikely
opposed brother's. What sister would think
liberty it, unless something
objectionable? If believed attached me, would try
part us; so, could succeed. By supposing
affection, make everybody acting unnaturally wrong,
unhappy. Do distress idea. I ashamed
mistaken--or, least, light, nothing comparison
I feel thinking ill sisters. Let take
best light, light may understood."

Elizabeth could oppose wish; time Mr. Bingley's
name scarcely ever mentioned them.

Mrs. Bennet still continued wonder repine returning
more, though day seldom passed Elizabeth account
clearly, little chance ever considering
less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured convince
believe herself, attentions Jane merely
effect common transient liking, ceased saw
more; though probability statement admitted
time, story repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best
comfort Mr. Bingley must summer.

Mr. Bennet treated matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said one day,
"your sister crossed love, I find. I congratulate her. Next
married, girl likes crossed little love then.
It something think of, gives sort distinction
among companions. When turn come? You hardly bear
long outdone Jane. Now time. Here officers enough
Meryton disappoint young ladies country. Let Wickham
_your_ man. He pleasant fellow, would jilt creditably."

"Thank you, sir, less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must
expect Jane's good fortune."

"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but comfort think whatever
kind may befall you, affectionate mother make
it."

Mr. Wickham's society material service dispelling gloom
late perverse occurrences thrown many Longbourn
family. They saw often, recommendations
added general unreserve. The whole Elizabeth already
heard, claims Mr. Darcy, suffered him,
openly acknowledged publicly canvassed; everybody
pleased know much always disliked Mr. Darcy
known anything matter.

Miss Bennet creature could suppose might
extenuating circumstances case, unknown society
Hertfordshire; mild steady candour always pleaded
allowances, urged possibility mistakes--but everybody else
Mr. Darcy condemned worst men.



Chapter 25


After week spent professions love schemes felicity,
Mr. Collins called amiable Charlotte arrival
Saturday. The pain separation, however, might alleviated
side, preparations reception bride; reason
hope, shortly return Hertfordshire, day would
fixed make happiest men. He took leave
relations Longbourn much solemnity before; wished fair
cousins health happiness again, promised father another
letter thanks.

On following Monday, Mrs. Bennet pleasure receiving
brother wife, came usual spend Christmas
Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior sister, well nature education. The Netherfield
ladies would difficulty believing man lived
trade, within view warehouses, could
well-bred agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, several years younger
Mrs. Bennet Mrs. Phillips, amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, great favourite Longbourn nieces. Between
two eldest especially, subsisted particular regard.
They frequently staying town.

The first part Mrs. Gardiner's business arrival
distribute presents describe newest fashions. When
done less active part play. It became turn listen.
Mrs. Bennet many grievances relate, much complain of. They
ill-used since last saw sister. Two
girls upon point marriage,
nothing it.

"I blame Jane," continued, "for Jane would got Mr.
Bingley could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It hard think
might Mr. Collins's wife time,
perverseness. He made offer room,
refused him. The consequence is, Lady Lucas
daughter married I have, Longbourn estate
much entailed ever. The Lucases artful people indeed,
sister. They get. I sorry say
them, is. It makes nervous poorly, thwarted
family, neighbours think
anybody else. However, coming time
greatest comforts, I glad hear tell us,
long sleeves."

Mrs. Gardiner, chief news given before,
course Jane Elizabeth's correspondence her, made
sister slight answer, and, compassion nieces, turned
conversation.

When alone Elizabeth afterwards, spoke subject. "It
seems likely desirable match Jane," said she. "I
sorry went off. But things happen often! A young man,
describe Mr. Bingley, easily falls love pretty girl
weeks, accident separates them, easily forgets
her, sort inconsistencies frequent."

"An excellent consolation way," said Elizabeth, "but
_us_. We suffer _accident_. It often
happen interference friends persuade young man
independent fortune think girl violently
love days before."

"But expression 'violently love' hackneyed,
doubtful, indefinite, gives little idea. It
often applied feelings arise half-hour's acquaintance,
real, strong attachment. Pray, _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's
love?"

"I never saw promising inclination; growing quite
inattentive people, wholly engrossed her. Every time
met, decided remarkable. At ball
offended two three young ladies, asking dance; I
spoke twice myself, without receiving answer. Could
finer symptoms? Is general incivility essence love?"

"Oh, yes!--of kind love I suppose felt. Poor
Jane! I sorry her, because, disposition, may get
immediately. It better happened _you_, Lizzy;
would laughed sooner. But think
would prevailed upon go back us? Change scene might
service--and perhaps little relief home may useful
anything."

Elizabeth exceedingly pleased proposal, felt persuaded
sister's ready acquiescence.

"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that consideration regard
young man influence her. We live different part
town, connections different, and, well know, go
little, improbable meet all,
unless really comes see her."

"And _that_ quite impossible; custody
friend, Mr. Darcy would suffer call Jane
part London! My dear aunt, could think it? Mr. Darcy may
perhaps _heard_ place Gracechurch Street,
would hardly think month's ablution enough cleanse
impurities, enter it; depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him."

"So much better. I hope meet all. But Jane
correspond sister? _She_ able help calling."

"She drop acquaintance entirely."

But spite certainty Elizabeth affected place
point, well still interesting one Bingley's
withheld seeing Jane, felt solicitude subject
convinced her, examination, consider entirely
hopeless. It possible, sometimes thought probable,
affection might reanimated, influence friends
successfully combated natural influence Jane's
attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted aunt's invitation pleasure;
Bingleys otherwise thoughts time,
hoped Caroline's living house brother,
might occasionally spend morning her, without danger
seeing him.

The Gardiners stayed week Longbourn; Phillipses,
Lucases, officers, day without
engagement. Mrs. Bennet carefully provided entertainment
brother sister, sit family
dinner. When engagement home, officers always
made part it--of officers Mr. Wickham sure one;
occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious Elizabeth's
warm commendation, narrowly observed both. Without supposing them,
saw, seriously love, preference
plain enough make little uneasy;
resolved speak Elizabeth subject left
Hertfordshire, represent imprudence encouraging
attachment.

To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham one means affording pleasure,
unconnected general powers. About ten dozen years ago,
marriage, spent considerable time
part Derbyshire belonged. They had, therefore, many
acquaintances common; though Wickham little since
death Darcy's father, yet power give fresher
intelligence former friends way
procuring.

Mrs. Gardiner seen Pemberley, known late Mr. Darcy
character perfectly well. Here consequently inexhaustible subject
discourse. In comparing recollection Pemberley minute
description Wickham could give, bestowing tribute
praise character late possessor, delighting
herself. On made acquainted present Mr. Darcy's
treatment him, tried remember gentleman's
reputed disposition quite lad might agree it,
confident last recollected heard Mr. Fitzwilliam
Darcy formerly spoken proud, ill-natured boy.



Chapter 26


Mrs. Gardiner's caution Elizabeth punctually kindly given
first favourable opportunity speaking alone;
honestly telling thought, thus went on:

"You sensible girl, Lizzy, fall love merely
warned it; and, therefore, I afraid speaking
openly. Seriously, I would guard. Do involve
endeavour involve affection want
fortune would make imprudent. I nothing say
_him_; interesting young man; fortune
ought have, I think could better. But is,
must let fancy run away you. You sense,
expect use it. Your father would depend _your_ resolution
good conduct, I sure. You must disappoint father."

"My dear aunt, serious indeed."

"Yes, I hope engage serious likewise."

"Well, then, need alarm. I take care
myself, Mr. Wickham too. He shall love me, I
prevent it."

"Elizabeth, serious now."

"I beg pardon, I try again. At present I love
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly not. But is, beyond comparison,
agreeable man I ever saw--and becomes really attached
me--I believe better not. I see imprudence
it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion
greatest honour, I miserable forfeit it. My
father, however, partial Mr. Wickham. In short, dear aunt, I
sorry means making unhappy;
since see every day affection, young people
seldom withheld immediate want fortune entering
engagements other, I promise wiser many
fellow-creatures I tempted, I even know
would wisdom resist? All I promise you, therefore,
hurry. I hurry believe first
object. When I company him, I wishing. In short,
I best."

"Perhaps well discourage coming
often. At least, _remind_ mother inviting him."

"As I day," said Elizabeth conscious smile: "very
true, wise refrain _that_. But imagine
always often. It account
frequently invited week. You know mother's ideas
necessity constant company friends. But really, upon
honour, I try I think wisest; I hope
satisfied."

Her aunt assured was, Elizabeth thanked
kindness hints, parted; wonderful instance advice
given point, without resented.

Mr. Collins returned Hertfordshire soon quitted
Gardiners Jane; took abode Lucases,
arrival great inconvenience Mrs. Bennet. His marriage
fast approaching, length far resigned think
inevitable, even repeatedly say, ill-natured tone,
"_wished_ might happy." Thursday wedding day,
Wednesday Miss Lucas paid farewell visit;
rose take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed mother's ungracious
reluctant good wishes, sincerely affected herself, accompanied
room. As went downstairs together, Charlotte said:

"I shall depend hearing often, Eliza."

"_That_ certainly shall."

"And I another favour ask you. Will come see me?"

"We shall often meet, I hope, Hertfordshire."

"I likely leave Kent time. Promise me, therefore,
come Hunsford."

Elizabeth could refuse, though foresaw little pleasure
visit.

"My father Maria coming March," added Charlotte, "and I
hope consent party. Indeed, Eliza,
welcome either them."

The wedding took place; bride bridegroom set Kent
church door, everybody much say, hear,
subject usual. Elizabeth soon heard friend;
correspondence regular frequent ever been;
equally unreserved impossible. Elizabeth could never
address without feeling comfort intimacy over,
though determined slacken correspondent,
sake been, rather was. Charlotte's first letters
received good deal eagerness; could
curiosity know would speak new home, would
like Lady Catherine, happy would dare pronounce
be; though, letters read, Elizabeth felt Charlotte
expressed every point exactly might foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded comforts, mentioned nothing
could praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood,
roads, taste, Lady Catherine's behaviour
friendly obliging. It Mr. Collins's picture Hunsford
Rosings rationally softened; Elizabeth perceived must wait
visit know rest.

Jane already written lines sister announce
safe arrival London; wrote again, Elizabeth hoped
would power say something Bingleys.

Her impatience second letter well rewarded impatience
generally is. Jane week town without either seeing
hearing Caroline. She accounted it, however, supposing
last letter friend Longbourn accident
lost.

"My aunt," continued, "is going to-morrow part
town, I shall take opportunity calling Grosvenor Street."

She wrote visit paid, seen Miss Bingley.
"I think Caroline spirits," words, "but
glad see me, reproached giving notice coming
London. I right, therefore, last letter never reached
her. I inquired brother, course. He well, much
engaged Mr. Darcy scarcely ever saw him. I found
Miss Darcy expected dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit
long, Caroline Mrs. Hurst going out. I dare say I shall
see soon here."

Elizabeth shook head letter. It convinced
accident could discover Mr. Bingley sister's town.

Four weeks passed away, Jane saw nothing him. She endeavoured
persuade regret it; could longer
blind Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting home every morning
fortnight, inventing every evening fresh excuse her,
visitor last appear; shortness stay, yet more,
alteration manner would allow Jane deceive
longer. The letter wrote occasion sister
prove felt.

"My dearest Lizzy will, I sure, incapable triumphing
better judgement, expense, I confess
entirely deceived Miss Bingley's regard me. But, dear sister,
though event proved right, think obstinate I
still assert that, considering behaviour was, confidence
natural suspicion. I comprehend reason
wishing intimate me; circumstances
happen again, I sure I deceived again. Caroline
return visit till yesterday; note, line, I
receive meantime. When come, evident
pleasure it; made slight, formal apology,
calling before, said word wishing see again,
every respect altered creature, went away I
perfectly resolved continue acquaintance longer. I pity,
though I cannot help blaming her. She wrong singling
did; I safely say every advance intimacy began
side. But I pity her, must feel acting
wrong, I sure anxiety brother
cause it. I need explain farther; though _we_ know
anxiety quite needless, yet feels it, easily
account behaviour me; deservedly dear
sister, whatever anxiety must feel behalf natural
amiable. I cannot wonder, however, fears now,
because, cared me, must met, long ago.
He knows town, I certain, something said
herself; yet would seem, manner talking,
wanted persuade really partial Miss Darcy. I
cannot understand it. If I afraid judging harshly, I
almost tempted say strong appearance duplicity
this. But I endeavour banish every painful thought,
think make happy--your affection,
invariable kindness dear uncle aunt. Let hear
soon. Miss Bingley said something never returning Netherfield
again, giving house, certainty. We better
mention it. I extremely glad pleasant accounts
friends Hunsford. Pray go see them, Sir William
Maria. I sure comfortable there.--Yours, etc."

This letter gave Elizabeth pain; spirits returned
considered Jane would longer duped, sister least.
All expectation brother absolutely over. She would
even wish renewal attentions. His character sunk
every review it; punishment him, well possible
advantage Jane, seriously hoped might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy's sister, Wickham's account, would make abundantly
regret thrown away.

Mrs. Gardiner time reminded Elizabeth promise
concerning gentleman, required information; Elizabeth
send might rather give contentment aunt
herself. His apparent partiality subsided, attentions over,
admirer one else. Elizabeth watchful enough
see all, could see write without material pain.
Her heart slightly touched, vanity satisfied
believing _she_ would choice, fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition ten thousand pounds
remarkable charm young lady rendering
agreeable; Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps case
Charlotte's, quarrel wish independence.
Nothing, contrary, could natural; able
suppose cost struggles relinquish her,
ready allow wise desirable measure both, could
sincerely wish happy.

All acknowledged Mrs. Gardiner; relating
circumstances, thus went on: "I convinced, dear aunt,
I never much love; I really experienced pure
elevating passion, I present detest name,
wish manner evil. But feelings cordial
towards _him_; even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
I hate all, I least unwilling
think good sort girl. There love this. My
watchfulness effectual; though I certainly
interesting object acquaintances I distractedly love
him, I cannot say I regret comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes purchased dearly. Kitty Lydia take
defection much heart I do. They young
ways world, yet open mortifying conviction
handsome young men must something live well plain."



Chapter 27


With greater events Longbourn family, otherwise
diversified little beyond walks Meryton, sometimes dirty
sometimes cold, January February pass away. March take
Elizabeth Hunsford. She first thought seriously
going thither; Charlotte, soon found, depending plan
gradually learned consider greater pleasure
well greater certainty. Absence increased desire seeing
Charlotte again, weakened disgust Mr. Collins. There
novelty scheme, as, mother
uncompanionable sisters, home could faultless, little change
unwelcome sake. The journey would moreover give
peep Jane; and, short, time drew near, would
sorry delay. Everything, however, went smoothly,
finally settled according Charlotte's first sketch. She
accompany Sir William second daughter. The improvement
spending night London added time, plan became
perfect plan could be.

The pain leaving father, would certainly miss her,
who, came point, little liked going,
told write him, almost promised answer letter.

The farewell Mr. Wickham perfectly friendly;
side even more. His present pursuit could make forget
Elizabeth first excite deserve attention,
first listen pity, first admired; manner
bidding adieu, wishing every enjoyment, reminding
expect Lady Catherine de Bourgh, trusting
opinion her--their opinion everybody--would always coincide,
solicitude, interest felt must ever attach
sincere regard; parted convinced that,
whether married single, must always model amiable
pleasing.

Her fellow-travellers next day kind make
think less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, daughter Maria,
good-humoured girl, empty-headed himself, nothing say
could worth hearing, listened much
delight rattle chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities,
known Sir William's long. He could tell nothing new
wonders presentation knighthood; civilities
worn out, like information.

It journey twenty-four miles, began early
Gracechurch Street noon. As drove Mr. Gardiner's
door, Jane drawing-room window watching arrival;
entered passage welcome them, Elizabeth,
looking earnestly face, pleased see healthful
lovely ever. On stairs troop little boys girls,
whose eagerness cousin's appearance would allow
wait drawing-room, whose shyness, seen
twelvemonth, prevented coming lower. All joy
kindness. The day passed pleasantly away; morning bustle
shopping, evening one theatres.

Elizabeth contrived sit aunt. Their first object
sister; grieved astonished hear, reply
minute inquiries, though Jane always struggled support
spirits, periods dejection. It reasonable, however,
hope would continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave
particulars also Miss Bingley's visit Gracechurch Street,
repeated conversations occurring different times Jane
herself, proved former had, heart, given
acquaintance.

Mrs. Gardiner rallied niece Wickham's desertion,
complimented bearing well.

"But dear Elizabeth," added, "what sort girl Miss King? I
sorry think friend mercenary."

"Pray, dear aunt, difference matrimonial affairs,
mercenary prudent motive? Where discretion end,
avarice begin? Last Christmas afraid marrying me,
would imprudent; now, trying get
girl ten thousand pounds, want find
mercenary."

"If tell sort girl Miss King is, I shall know
think."

"She good kind girl, I believe. I know harm her."

"But paid smallest attention till grandfather's death
made mistress fortune."

"No--why he? If allowable gain _my_
affections I money, occasion could
making love girl care about, equally
poor?"

"But seems indelicacy directing attentions towards
soon event."

"A man distressed circumstances time elegant
decorums people may observe. If _she_ object it,
_we_?"

"_Her_ objecting justify _him_. It shows
deficient something herself--sense feeling."

"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have choose. _He_ shall
mercenary, _she_ shall foolish."

"No, Lizzy, I _not_ choose. I sorry, know,
think ill young man lived long Derbyshire."

"Oh! all, I poor opinion young men live
Derbyshire; intimate friends live Hertfordshire
much better. I sick all. Thank Heaven! I going to-morrow
I shall find man one agreeable quality,
neither manner sense recommend him. Stupid men ones
worth knowing, all."

"Take care, Lizzy; speech savours strongly disappointment."

Before separated conclusion play,
unexpected happiness invitation accompany uncle aunt
tour pleasure proposed taking summer.

"We determined far shall carry us," said Mrs. Gardiner,
"but, perhaps, Lakes."

No scheme could agreeable Elizabeth,
acceptance invitation ready grateful. "Oh, dear,
dear aunt," rapturously cried, "what delight! felicity! You
give fresh life vigour. Adieu disappointment spleen. What
young men rocks mountains? Oh! hours transport
shall spend! And _do_ return, shall like
travellers, without able give one accurate idea anything. We
_will_ know gone--we _will_ recollect seen.
Lakes, mountains, rivers shall jumbled together
imaginations; attempt describe particular scene,
begin quarreling relative situation. Let _our_
first effusions less insupportable generality
travellers."



Chapter 28


Every object next day's journey new interesting
Elizabeth; spirits state enjoyment;
seen sister looking well banish fear health,
prospect northern tour constant source delight.

When left high road lane Hunsford, every eye
search Parsonage, every turning expected bring view.
The palings Rosings Park boundary one side. Elizabeth
smiled recollection heard inhabitants.

At length Parsonage discernible. The garden sloping
road, house standing it, green pales, laurel hedge,
everything declared arriving. Mr. Collins Charlotte
appeared door, carriage stopped small gate
led short gravel walk house, amidst nods smiles
whole party. In moment chaise, rejoicing
sight other. Mrs. Collins welcomed friend
liveliest pleasure, Elizabeth satisfied
coming found affectionately received. She saw
instantly cousin's manners altered marriage;
formal civility been, detained
minutes gate hear satisfy inquiries
family. They then, delay pointing
neatness entrance, taken house; soon
parlour, welcomed second time, ostentatious
formality humble abode, punctually repeated wife's
offers refreshment.

Elizabeth prepared see glory; could help
fancying displaying good proportion room,
aspect furniture, addressed particularly her,
wishing make feel lost refusing him. But
though everything seemed neat comfortable, able
gratify sigh repentance, rather looked wonder
friend could cheerful air companion.
When Mr. Collins said anything wife might reasonably
ashamed, certainly unseldom, involuntarily turned
eye Charlotte. Once twice could discern faint blush;
general Charlotte wisely hear. After sitting long enough
admire every article furniture room, sideboard
fender, give account journey,
happened London, Mr. Collins invited take stroll
garden, large well laid out, cultivation
attended himself. To work garden one
respectable pleasures; Elizabeth admired command countenance
Charlotte talked healthfulness exercise,
owned encouraged much possible. Here, leading way
every walk cross walk, scarcely allowing
interval utter praises asked for, every view pointed
minuteness left beauty entirely behind. He could number
fields every direction, could tell many trees
distant clump. But views garden,
country kingdom could boast, none compared
prospect Rosings, afforded opening trees bordered
park nearly opposite front house. It handsome
modern building, well situated rising ground.

From garden, Mr. Collins would led round two meadows;
ladies, shoes encounter remains white
frost, turned back; Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took sister friend house, extremely well pleased,
probably, opportunity showing without husband's
help. It rather small, well built convenient; everything
fitted arranged neatness consistency
Elizabeth gave Charlotte credit. When Mr. Collins could
forgotten, really air great comfort throughout,
Charlotte's evident enjoyment it, Elizabeth supposed must often
forgotten.

She already learnt Lady Catherine still country. It
spoken dinner, Mr. Collins joining
in, observed:

"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, honour seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh ensuing Sunday church, I need say
delighted her. She affability condescension, I
doubt honoured portion notice
service over. I scarcely hesitation saying
include sister Maria every invitation
honours us stay here. Her behaviour dear Charlotte
charming. We dine Rosings twice every week, never allowed
walk home. Her ladyship's carriage regularly ordered us. I
_should_ say, one ladyship's carriages, several."

"Lady Catherine respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
Charlotte, "and attentive neighbour."

"Very true, dear, exactly I say. She sort
woman one cannot regard much deference."

The evening spent chiefly talking Hertfordshire news,
telling already written; closed,
Elizabeth, solitude chamber, meditate upon
Charlotte's degree contentment, understand address guiding,
composure bearing with, husband, acknowledge
done well. She also anticipate visit
would pass, quiet tenor usual employments, vexatious
interruptions Mr. Collins, gaieties intercourse
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled all.

About middle next day, room getting ready
walk, sudden noise seemed speak whole house
confusion; and, listening moment, heard somebody running
stairs violent hurry, calling loudly her. She opened
door met Maria landing place, who, breathless
agitation, cried out--

"Oh, dear Eliza! pray make haste come dining-room,
sight seen! I tell is. Make
haste, come moment."

Elizabeth asked questions vain; Maria would tell nothing more,
ran dining-room, fronted lane,
quest wonder; It two ladies stopping low phaeton
garden gate.

"And all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected least pigs
got garden, nothing Lady Catherine
daughter."

"La! dear," said Maria, quite shocked mistake, "it
Lady Catherine. The old lady Mrs. Jenkinson, lives them;
Miss de Bourgh. Only look her. She quite little
creature. Who would thought could thin small?"

"She abominably rude keep Charlotte doors wind.
Why come in?"

"Oh, Charlotte says hardly ever does. It greatest favours
Miss de Bourgh comes in."

"I like appearance," said Elizabeth, struck ideas. "She
looks sickly cross. Yes, well. She
make proper wife."

Mr. Collins Charlotte standing gate conversation
ladies; Sir William, Elizabeth's high diversion,
stationed doorway, earnest contemplation greatness
him, constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked
way.

At length nothing said; ladies drove on,
others returned house. Mr. Collins sooner saw two
girls began congratulate good fortune,
Charlotte explained letting know whole party asked
dine Rosings next day.



Chapter 29


Mr. Collins's triumph, consequence invitation, complete.
The power displaying grandeur patroness wondering
visitors, letting see civility towards
wife, exactly wished for; opportunity
given soon, instance Lady
Catherine's condescension, knew admire enough.

"I confess," said he, "that I surprised
ladyship's asking us Sunday drink tea spend evening
Rosings. I rather expected, knowledge affability,
would happen. But could foreseen attention this? Who
could imagined receive invitation dine
(an invitation, moreover, including whole party) immediately
arrival!"

"I less surprised happened," replied Sir William,
"from knowledge manners great really are,
situation life allowed acquire. About court,
instances elegant breeding uncommon."

Scarcely anything talked whole day next morning
visit Rosings. Mr. Collins carefully instructing
expect, sight rooms, many servants,
splendid dinner, might wholly overpower them.

When ladies separating toilette, said Elizabeth--

"Do make uneasy, dear cousin, apparel. Lady
Catherine far requiring elegance dress us
becomes daughter. I would advise merely put
whatever clothes superior rest--there occasion
anything more. Lady Catherine think worse
simply dressed. She likes distinction rank
preserved."

While dressing, came two three times different
doors, recommend quick, Lady Catherine much
objected kept waiting dinner. Such formidable accounts
ladyship, manner living, quite frightened Maria Lucas
little used company, looked forward
introduction Rosings much apprehension father done
presentation St. James's.

As weather fine, pleasant walk half
mile across park. Every park beauty prospects;
Elizabeth saw much pleased with, though could
raptures Mr. Collins expected scene inspire,
slightly affected enumeration windows front
house, relation glazing altogether originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.

When ascended steps hall, Maria's alarm every
moment increasing, even Sir William look perfectly calm.
Elizabeth's courage fail her. She heard nothing Lady
Catherine spoke awful extraordinary talents
miraculous virtue, mere stateliness money rank thought
could witness without trepidation.

From entrance-hall, Mr. Collins pointed out,
rapturous air, fine proportion finished ornaments,
followed servants ante-chamber, room Lady
Catherine, daughter, Mrs. Jenkinson sitting. Her ladyship,
great condescension, arose receive them; Mrs. Collins
settled husband office introduction
hers, performed proper manner, without
apologies thanks would thought necessary.

In spite St. James's Sir William completely
awed grandeur surrounding him, courage
enough make low bow, take seat without saying word;
daughter, frightened almost senses, sat edge
chair, knowing way look. Elizabeth found
quite equal scene, could observe three ladies
composedly. Lady Catherine tall, large woman, strongly-marked
features, might handsome. Her air
conciliating, manner receiving make
visitors forget inferior rank. She rendered formidable
silence; whatever said spoken authoritative tone,
marked self-importance, brought Mr. Wickham immediately
Elizabeth's mind; observation day altogether,
believed Lady Catherine exactly represented.

When, examining mother, whose countenance deportment
soon found resemblance Mr. Darcy, turned eyes
daughter, could almost joined Maria's astonishment
thin small. There neither figure face
likeness ladies. Miss de Bourgh pale sickly;
features, though plain, insignificant; spoke
little, except low voice, Mrs. Jenkinson, whose appearance
nothing remarkable, entirely engaged listening
said, placing screen proper direction
eyes.

After sitting minutes, sent one windows
admire view, Mr. Collins attending point beauties,
Lady Catherine kindly informing much better worth
looking summer.

The dinner exceedingly handsome, servants
articles plate Mr. Collins promised; and,
likewise foretold, took seat bottom table,
ladyship's desire, looked felt life could furnish
nothing greater. He carved, ate, praised delighted
alacrity; every dish commended, first Sir
William, enough recovered echo whatever son-in-law
said, manner Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified excessive admiration,
gave gracious smiles, especially dish table proved
novelty them. The party supply much conversation. Elizabeth
ready speak whenever opening, seated
Charlotte Miss de Bourgh--the former engaged
listening Lady Catherine, latter said word
dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson chiefly employed watching little
Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing try dish, fearing
indisposed. Maria thought speaking question,
gentlemen nothing eat admire.

When ladies returned drawing-room, little
done hear Lady Catherine talk, without
intermission till coffee came in, delivering opinion every
subject decisive manner, proved used
judgement controverted. She inquired Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly minutely, gave great deal advice
management all; told everything ought
regulated small family hers, instructed
care cows poultry. Elizabeth found nothing
beneath great lady's attention, could furnish
occasion dictating others. In intervals discourse
Mrs. Collins, addressed variety questions Maria
Elizabeth, especially latter, whose connections knew
least, observed Mrs. Collins genteel,
pretty kind girl. She asked her, different times, many sisters
had, whether older younger herself, whether
likely married, whether handsome,
educated, carriage father kept,
mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt impertinence
questions answered composedly. Lady Catherine
observed,

"Your father's estate entailed Mr. Collins, I think. For
sake," turning Charlotte, "I glad it; otherwise I see
occasion entailing estates female line. It thought
necessary Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do play sing, Miss
Bennet?"

"A little."

"Oh! then--some time shall happy hear you. Our
instrument capital one, probably superior to----You shall try
day. Do sisters play sing?"

"One does."

"Why learn? You ought learned. The Miss
Webbs play, father good income yours. Do
draw?"

"No, all."

"What, none you?"

"Not one."

"That strange. But I suppose opportunity. Your mother
taken town every spring benefit masters."

"My mother would objection, father hates London."

"Has governess left you?"

"We never governess."

"No governess! How possible? Five daughters brought home
without governess! I never heard thing. Your mother must
quite slave education."

Elizabeth could hardly help smiling assured
case.

"Then, taught you? attended you? Without governess,
must neglected."

"Compared families, I believe were; us
wished learn never wanted means. We always encouraged
read, masters necessary. Those chose
idle, certainly might."

"Aye, doubt; governess prevent, I
known mother, I advised strenuously engage
one. I always say nothing done education without steady
regular instruction, nobody governess give it. It
wonderful many families I means supplying
way. I always glad get young person well placed out. Four nieces
Mrs. Jenkinson delightfully situated means;
day I recommended another young person,
merely accidentally mentioned me, family quite
delighted her. Mrs. Collins, I tell Lady Metcalf's
calling yesterday thank me? She finds Miss Pope treasure. 'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you given treasure.' Are
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"

"Yes, ma'am, all."

"All! What, five once? Very odd! And second. The
younger ones elder ones married! Your younger sisters
must young?"

"Yes, youngest sixteen. Perhaps _she_ full young
much company. But really, ma'am, I think would hard upon
younger sisters, share society
amusement, elder may means inclination
marry early. The last-born good right pleasures youth
first. And kept back _such_ motive! I think would
likely promote sisterly affection delicacy mind."

"Upon word," said ladyship, "you give opinion decidedly
young person. Pray, age?"

"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth, smiling, "your
ladyship hardly expect it."

Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished receiving direct answer;
Elizabeth suspected first creature ever
dared trifle much dignified impertinence.

"You cannot twenty, I sure, therefore need
conceal age."

"I one-and-twenty."

When gentlemen joined them, tea over, card-tables
placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, Mr. Mrs. Collins sat
quadrille; Miss de Bourgh chose play cassino,
two girls honour assisting Mrs. Jenkinson make
party. Their table superlatively stupid. Scarcely syllable
uttered relate game, except Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed fears Miss de Bourgh's hot cold,
much little light. A great deal passed
table. Lady Catherine generally speaking--stating mistakes
three others, relating anecdote herself. Mr. Collins
employed agreeing everything ladyship said, thanking
every fish won, apologising thought many.
Sir William say much. He storing memory anecdotes
noble names.

When Lady Catherine daughter played long chose,
tables broken up, carriage offered Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted immediately ordered. The party gathered
round fire hear Lady Catherine determine weather
morrow. From instructions summoned
arrival coach; many speeches thankfulness Mr.
Collins's side many bows Sir William's departed. As soon
driven door, Elizabeth called cousin
give opinion seen Rosings, which,
Charlotte's sake, made favourable really was. But
commendation, though costing trouble, could means satisfy
Mr. Collins, soon obliged take ladyship's praise
hands.



Chapter 30


Sir William stayed week Hunsford, visit long
enough convince daughter's comfortably settled,
possessing husband neighbour
often met with. While Sir William them, Mr. Collins devoted
morning driving gig, showing country;
went away, whole family returned usual employments,
Elizabeth thankful find see
cousin alteration, chief time breakfast
dinner passed either work garden
reading writing, looking window book-room,
fronted road. The room ladies sat backwards.
Elizabeth first rather wondered Charlotte prefer
dining-parlour common use; better sized room,
pleasant aspect; soon saw friend excellent
reason did, Mr. Collins would undoubtedly
much less apartment, sat one equally lively;
gave Charlotte credit arrangement.

From drawing-room could distinguish nothing lane,
indebted Mr. Collins knowledge carriages went
along, often especially Miss de Bourgh drove phaeton,
never failed coming inform of, though happened
almost every day. She unfrequently stopped Parsonage,
minutes' conversation Charlotte, scarcely ever
prevailed upon get out.

Very days passed Mr. Collins walk Rosings,
many wife think necessary go likewise;
till Elizabeth recollected might family livings
disposed of, could understand sacrifice many
hours. Now honoured call ladyship,
nothing escaped observation passing room
visits. She examined employments, looked work,
advised differently; found fault arrangement
furniture; detected housemaid negligence;
accepted refreshment, seemed sake finding
Mrs. Collins's joints meat large family.

Elizabeth soon perceived, though great lady
commission peace county, active magistrate
parish, minutest concerns carried
Mr. Collins; whenever cottagers disposed
quarrelsome, discontented, poor, sallied forth
village settle differences, silence complaints, scold
harmony plenty.

The entertainment dining Rosings repeated twice week;
and, allowing loss Sir William, one
card-table evening, every entertainment counterpart
first. Their engagements few, style living
neighbourhood general beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,
however, evil Elizabeth, upon whole spent time
comfortably enough; half-hours pleasant conversation
Charlotte, weather fine time year
often great enjoyment doors. Her favourite walk,
frequently went others calling Lady Catherine,
along open grove edged side park,
nice sheltered path, one seemed value herself,
felt beyond reach Lady Catherine's curiosity.

In quiet way, first fortnight visit soon passed away.
Easter approaching, week preceding bring
addition family Rosings, small circle must
important. Elizabeth heard soon arrival Mr. Darcy
expected course weeks, though
many acquaintances prefer, coming would
furnish one comparatively new look Rosings parties,
might amused seeing hopeless Miss Bingley's designs
were, behaviour cousin, evidently
destined Lady Catherine, talked coming greatest
satisfaction, spoke terms highest admiration,
seemed almost angry find already frequently seen
Miss Lucas herself.

His arrival soon known Parsonage; Mr. Collins walking
whole morning within view lodges opening Hunsford Lane,
order earliest assurance it, making
bow carriage turned Park, hurried home great
intelligence. On following morning hastened Rosings pay
respects. There two nephews Lady Catherine require them,
Mr. Darcy brought Colonel Fitzwilliam, younger son
uncle Lord ----, and, great surprise party,
Mr. Collins returned, gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte seen
husband's room, crossing road, immediately running
other, told girls honour might expect, adding:

"I may thank you, Eliza, piece civility. Mr. Darcy would
never come soon wait upon me."

Elizabeth scarcely time disclaim right compliment,
approach announced door-bell, shortly
afterwards three gentlemen entered room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
led way, thirty, handsome, person
address truly gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked
used look Hertfordshire--paid compliments, usual
reserve, Mrs. Collins, whatever might feelings toward
friend, met every appearance composure. Elizabeth merely
curtseyed without saying word.

Colonel Fitzwilliam entered conversation directly
readiness ease well-bred man, talked pleasantly;
cousin, addressed slight observation house
garden Mrs. Collins, sat time without speaking anybody.
At length, however, civility far awakened inquire
Elizabeth health family. She answered usual
way, moment's pause, added:

"My eldest sister town three months. Have never
happened see there?"

She perfectly sensible never had; wished see
whether would betray consciousness passed
Bingleys Jane, thought looked little confused
answered never fortunate meet Miss Bennet. The
subject pursued farther, gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.



Chapter 31


Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners much admired Parsonage,
ladies felt must add considerably pleasures
engagements Rosings. It days, however,
received invitation thither--for visitors
house, could necessary; till Easter-day,
almost week gentlemen's arrival, honoured
attention, merely asked leaving church
come evening. For last week seen little
Lady Catherine daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam called
Parsonage time, Mr. Darcy seen
church.

The invitation accepted course, proper hour joined
party Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received
civilly, plain company means
acceptable could get nobody else; was, fact,
almost engrossed nephews, speaking them, especially Darcy,
much person room.

Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad see them; anything
welcome relief Rosings; Mrs. Collins's pretty friend
moreover caught fancy much. He seated her,
talked agreeably Kent Hertfordshire, travelling staying
home, new books music, Elizabeth never half
well entertained room before; conversed much
spirit flow, draw attention Lady Catherine herself,
well Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes soon repeatedly turned
towards look curiosity; ladyship,
while, shared feeling, openly acknowledged,
scruple call out:

"What saying, Fitzwilliam? What talking
of? What telling Miss Bennet? Let hear is."

"We speaking music, madam," said he, longer able avoid
reply.

"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It subjects delight. I
must share conversation speaking music.
There people England, I suppose, true enjoyment
music myself, better natural taste. If I ever learnt,
I great proficient. And would Anne, health
allowed apply. I confident would performed
delightfully. How Georgiana get on, Darcy?"

Mr. Darcy spoke affectionate praise sister's proficiency.

"I glad hear good account her," said Lady
Catherine; "and pray tell me, cannot expect excel
practice good deal."

"I assure you, madam," replied, "that need advice.
She practises constantly."

"So much better. It cannot done much; I next write
her, I shall charge neglect account. I often
tell young ladies excellence music acquired without
constant practice. I told Miss Bennet several times,
never play really well unless practises more; though Mrs.
Collins instrument, welcome, I often told
her, come Rosings every day, play pianoforte Mrs.
Jenkinson's room. She would nobody's way, know, part
house."

Mr. Darcy looked little ashamed aunt's ill-breeding, made
answer.

When coffee over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth
promised play him; sat directly instrument. He
drew chair near her. Lady Catherine listened half song,
talked, before, nephew; till latter walked away
her, making usual deliberation towards pianoforte
stationed command full view fair performer's
countenance. Elizabeth saw doing, first
convenient pause, turned arch smile, said:

"You mean frighten me, Mr. Darcy, coming state hear
me? I alarmed though sister _does_ play well. There
stubbornness never bear frightened
others. My courage always rises every attempt intimidate
me."

"I shall say mistaken," replied, "because could
really believe entertain design alarming you; I
pleasure acquaintance long enough know find
great enjoyment occasionally professing opinions fact
own."

Elizabeth laughed heartily picture herself, said
Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin give pretty notion
me, teach believe word I say. I particularly unlucky
meeting person able expose real character, part
world I hoped pass degree
credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, ungenerous mention
knew disadvantage Hertfordshire--and, give leave
say, impolitic too--for provoking retaliate,
things may come shock relations hear."

"I afraid you," said he, smilingly.

"Pray let hear accuse of," cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. "I like know behaves among strangers."

"You shall hear then--but prepare something dreadful.
The first time ever seeing Hertfordshire, must know,
ball--and ball, think did? He danced
four dances, though gentlemen scarce; and, certain
knowledge, one young lady sitting want
partner. Mr. Darcy, cannot deny fact."

"I time honour knowing lady assembly
beyond party."

"True; nobody ever introduced ball-room. Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, I play next? My fingers wait orders."

"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I judged better, I sought
introduction; I ill-qualified recommend strangers."

"Shall ask cousin reason this?" said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall ask man sense
education, lived world, ill qualified recommend
strangers?"

"I answer question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying
him. It give trouble."

"I certainly talent people possess," said Darcy,
"of conversing easily I never seen before. I cannot
catch tone conversation, appear interested
concerns, I often see done."

"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do move instrument
masterly manner I see many women's do. They
force rapidity, produce expression. But I
always supposed fault--because I take
trouble practising. It I believe _my_ fingers
capable woman's superior execution."

Darcy smiled said, "You perfectly right. You employed
time much better. No one admitted privilege hearing
think anything wanting. We neither us perform strangers."

Here interrupted Lady Catherine, called know
talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Lady Catherine approached, and, listening minutes, said
Darcy:

"Miss Bennet would play amiss practised more,
could advantage London master. She good notion
fingering, though taste equal Anne's. Anne would
delightful performer, health allowed learn."

Elizabeth looked Darcy see cordially assented
cousin's praise; neither moment could
discern symptom love; whole behaviour Miss
de Bourgh derived comfort Miss Bingley, might
likely marry _her_, relation.

Lady Catherine continued remarks Elizabeth's performance, mixing
many instructions execution taste. Elizabeth received
forbearance civility, and, request
gentlemen, remained instrument till ladyship's carriage
ready take home.



Chapter 32


Elizabeth sitting next morning, writing Jane
Mrs. Collins Maria gone business village,
startled ring door, certain signal
visitor. As heard carriage, thought unlikely
Lady Catherine, apprehension putting away
half-finished letter might escape impertinent questions,
door opened, and, great surprise, Mr. Darcy,
Mr. Darcy only, entered room.

He seemed astonished finding alone, apologised
intrusion letting know understood ladies
within.

They sat down, inquiries Rosings made,
seemed danger sinking total silence. It absolutely
necessary, therefore, think something, emergence
recollecting _when_ seen last Hertfordshire,
feeling curious know would say subject hasty
departure, observed:

"How suddenly quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
It must agreeable surprise Mr. Bingley see
soon; for, I recollect right, went day
before. He sisters well, I hope, left London?"

"Perfectly so, I thank you."

She found receive answer, and, short
pause added:

"I think I understood Mr. Bingley much idea ever
returning Netherfield again?"

"I never heard say so; probable may spend
little time future. He many friends,
time life friends engagements continually
increasing."

"If means little Netherfield, would better
neighbourhood give place entirely,
might possibly get settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley
take house much convenience neighbourhood
own, must expect keep quit
principle."

"I surprised," said Darcy, "if give
soon eligible purchase offers."

Elizabeth made answer. She afraid talking longer
friend; and, nothing else say, determined leave
trouble finding subject him.

He took hint, soon began with, "This seems comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, great deal Mr.
Collins first came Hunsford."

"I believe did--and I sure could bestowed
kindness grateful object."

"Mr. Collins appears fortunate choice wife."

"Yes, indeed, friends may well rejoice met one
sensible women would accepted him, made
happy had. My friend excellent understanding--though
I certain I consider marrying Mr. Collins
wisest thing ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however,
prudential light certainly good match her."

"It must agreeable settled within easy
distance family friends."

"An easy distance, call it? It nearly fifty miles."

"And fifty miles good road? Little half day's
journey. Yes, I call _very_ easy distance."

"I never considered distance one _advantages_
match," cried Elizabeth. "I never said Mrs. Collins
settled _near_ family."

"It proof attachment Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
neighbourhood Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."

As spoke sort smile Elizabeth fancied
understood; must supposing thinking Jane
Netherfield, blushed answered:

"I mean say woman may settled near
family. The far near must relative, depend many
varying circumstances. Where fortune make expenses
travelling unimportant, distance becomes evil. But
case _here_. Mr. Mrs. Collins comfortable income,
one allow frequent journeys--and I persuaded
friend would call _near_ family less _half_
present distance."

Mr. Darcy drew chair little towards her, said, "_You_ cannot
right strong local attachment. _You_ cannot
always Longbourn."

Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced change
feeling; drew back chair, took newspaper table,
glancing it, said, colder voice:

"Are pleased Kent?"

A short dialogue subject country ensued, either side
calm concise--and soon put end entrance Charlotte
sister, returned walk. The tete-a-tete surprised
them. Mr. Darcy related mistake occasioned intruding
Miss Bennet, sitting minutes longer without saying
much anybody, went away.

"What meaning this?" said Charlotte, soon
gone. "My dear, Eliza, must love you, would never
called us familiar way."

But Elizabeth told silence; seem likely,
even Charlotte's wishes, case; various
conjectures, could last suppose visit proceed
difficulty finding anything do, probable
time year. All field sports over. Within doors
Lady Catherine, books, billiard-table, gentlemen cannot
always within doors; nearness Parsonage,
pleasantness walk it, people lived it,
two cousins found temptation period walking thither
almost every day. They called various times morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, accompanied
aunt. It plain Colonel Fitzwilliam came
pleasure society, persuasion course recommended
still more; Elizabeth reminded satisfaction
him, well evident admiration her,
former favourite George Wickham; though, comparing them, saw
less captivating softness Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
believed might best informed mind.

But Mr. Darcy came often Parsonage, difficult
understand. It could society, frequently sat
ten minutes together without opening lips; speak,
seemed effect necessity rather choice--a sacrifice
propriety, pleasure himself. He seldom appeared really
animated. Mrs. Collins knew make him. Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing stupidity, proved
generally different, knowledge could told
her; would liked believed change effect
love, object love friend Eliza, set
seriously work find out. She watched whenever
Rosings, whenever came Hunsford; without much success. He
certainly looked friend great deal, expression
look disputable. It earnest, steadfast gaze, often
doubted whether much admiration it, sometimes
seemed nothing absence mind.

She twice suggested Elizabeth possibility
partial her, Elizabeth always laughed idea; Mrs.
Collins think right press subject, danger
raising expectations might end disappointment;
opinion admitted doubt, friend's dislike would
vanish, could suppose power.


In kind schemes Elizabeth, sometimes planned marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He beyond comparison pleasant man;
certainly admired her, situation life eligible; but,
counterbalance advantages, Mr. Darcy considerable patronage
church, cousin could none all.



Chapter 33


More Elizabeth, ramble within park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt perverseness
mischance bring one else brought, and,
prevent ever happening again, took care inform first
favourite haunt hers. How could occur second time,
therefore, odd! Yet did, even third. It seemed like
wilful ill-nature, voluntary penance, occasions
merely formal inquiries awkward pause away,
actually thought necessary turn back walk her. He
never said great deal, give trouble talking
listening much; struck course third
rencontre asking odd unconnected questions--about
pleasure Hunsford, love solitary walks,
opinion Mr. Mrs. Collins's happiness; speaking
Rosings perfectly understanding house, seemed
expect whenever came Kent would staying
_there_ too. His words seemed imply it. Could Colonel
Fitzwilliam thoughts? She supposed, meant anything, must
mean allusion might arise quarter. It distressed
little, quite glad find gate
pales opposite Parsonage.

She engaged one day walked, perusing Jane's last letter,
dwelling passages proved Jane written
spirits, when, instead surprised Mr. Darcy, saw
looking Colonel Fitzwilliam meeting her. Putting away
letter immediately forcing smile, said:

"I know ever walked way."

"I making tour park," replied, "as I generally
every year, intend close call Parsonage. Are
going much farther?"

"No, I turned moment."

And accordingly turn, walked towards Parsonage
together.

"Do certainly leave Kent Saturday?" said she.

"Yes--if Darcy put again. But I disposal. He
arranges business pleases."

"And able please arrangement, least
pleasure great power choice. I know anybody seems
enjoy power likes Mr. Darcy."

"He likes way well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
"But do. It better means
many others, rich, many others poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, know, must inured self-denial
dependence."

"In opinion, younger son earl know little
either. Now seriously, ever known self-denial
dependence? When prevented want money going
wherever chose, procuring anything fancy for?"

"These home questions--and perhaps I cannot say I
experienced many hardships nature. But matters greater
weight, I may suffer want money. Younger sons cannot marry
like."

"Unless like women fortune, I think often
do."

"Our habits expense make us dependent, many
rank life afford marry without attention
money."

"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant me?" coloured
idea; but, recovering herself, said lively tone, "And pray,
usual price earl's younger son? Unless elder brother
sickly, I suppose would ask fifty thousand pounds."

He answered style, subject dropped. To interrupt
silence might make fancy affected passed,
soon afterwards said:

"I imagine cousin brought chiefly sake
someone disposal. I wonder marry, secure
lasting convenience kind. But, perhaps, sister well
present, and, sole care, may
likes her."

"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that advantage must
divide me. I joined guardianship Miss Darcy."

"Are indeed? And pray sort guardians make? Does
charge give much trouble? Young ladies age sometimes
little difficult manage, true Darcy spirit,
may like way."

As spoke observed looking earnestly; manner
immediately asked supposed Miss Darcy likely
give uneasiness, convinced somehow
got pretty near truth. She directly replied:

"You need frightened. I never heard harm her; I dare
say one tractable creatures world. She
great favourite ladies acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst
Miss Bingley. I think I heard say know them."

"I know little. Their brother pleasant gentlemanlike man--he
great friend Darcy's."

"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily; "Mr. Darcy uncommonly kind Mr.
Bingley, takes prodigious deal care him."

"Care him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care
points wants care. From something told
journey hither, I reason think Bingley much indebted
him. But I ought beg pardon, I right suppose
Bingley person meant. It conjecture."

"What mean?"

"It circumstance Darcy could wish generally known,
get round lady's family, would
unpleasant thing."

"You may depend upon mentioning it."

"And remember I much reason supposing
Bingley. What told merely this: congratulated
lately saved friend inconveniences
imprudent marriage, without mentioning names
particulars, I suspected Bingley believing
kind young man get scrape sort,
knowing together whole last summer."

"Did Mr. Darcy give reasons interference?"

"I understood strong objections
lady."

"And arts use separate them?"

"He talk arts," said Fitzwilliam, smiling. "He
told I told you."

Elizabeth made answer, walked on, heart swelling
indignation. After watching little, Fitzwilliam asked
thoughtful.

"I thinking telling me," said she. "Your
cousin's conduct suit feelings. Why judge?"

"You rather disposed call interference officious?"

"I see right Mr. Darcy decide propriety
friend's inclination, why, upon judgement alone,
determine direct manner friend happy.
But," continued, recollecting herself, "as know none
particulars, fair condemn him. It supposed
much affection case."

"That unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but
lessening honour cousin's triumph sadly."

This spoken jestingly; appeared picture
Mr. Darcy, would trust answer,
therefore, abruptly changing conversation talked indifferent
matters reached Parsonage. There, shut room,
soon visitor left them, could think without interruption
heard. It supposed
people could meant connected. There
could exist world _two_ men Mr. Darcy could
boundless influence. That concerned measures
taken separate Bingley Jane never doubted;
always attributed Miss Bingley principal design arrangement
them. If vanity, however, mislead him, _he_
cause, pride caprice cause, Jane
suffered, still continued suffer. He ruined
every hope happiness affectionate, generous heart
world; one could say lasting evil might inflicted.

"There strong objections lady," Colonel
Fitzwilliam's words; strong objections probably were,
one uncle country attorney, another
business London.

"To Jane herself," exclaimed, "there could possibility
objection; loveliness goodness is!--her understanding
excellent, mind improved, manners captivating. Neither
could anything urged father, who, though
peculiarities, abilities Mr. Darcy need disdain,
respectability probably never reach." When thought
mother, confidence gave way little; would allow
objections _there_ material weight Mr. Darcy, whose
pride, convinced, would receive deeper wound want
importance friend's connections, want sense;
quite decided, last, partly governed
worst kind pride, partly wish retaining Mr.
Bingley sister.

The agitation tears subject occasioned, brought
headache; grew much worse towards evening, that, added
unwillingness see Mr. Darcy, determined attend
cousins Rosings, engaged drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
seeing really unwell, press go much
possible prevented husband pressing her; Mr. Collins
could conceal apprehension Lady Catherine's rather
displeased staying home.



Chapter 34


When gone, Elizabeth, intending exasperate
much possible Mr. Darcy, chose employment
examination letters Jane written since
Kent. They contained actual complaint,
revival past occurrences, communication present suffering.
But all, almost every line each, want
cheerfulness used characterise style, which,
proceeding serenity mind ease kindly
disposed towards everyone, scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying idea uneasiness,
attention hardly received first perusal. Mr. Darcy's
shameful boast misery able inflict, gave
keener sense sister's sufferings. It consolation
think visit Rosings end day
next--and, still greater, less fortnight
Jane again, enabled contribute recovery
spirits, affection could do.

She could think Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering
cousin go him; Colonel Fitzwilliam made clear
intentions all, agreeable was,
mean unhappy him.

While settling point, suddenly roused sound
door-bell, spirits little fluttered idea
Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, called late
evening, might come inquire particularly her.
But idea soon banished, spirits differently
affected, when, utter amazement, saw Mr. Darcy walk
room. In hurried manner immediately began inquiry
health, imputing visit wish hearing better.
She answered cold civility. He sat moments,
getting up, walked room. Elizabeth surprised,
said word. After silence several minutes, came towards
agitated manner, thus began:

"In vain I struggled. It do. My feelings
repressed. You must allow tell ardently I admire love
you."

Elizabeth's astonishment beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
doubted, silent. This considered sufficient encouragement;
avowal felt, long felt her,
immediately followed. He spoke well; feelings besides
heart detailed; eloquent
subject tenderness pride. His sense inferiority--of
degradation--of family obstacles always
opposed inclination, dwelt warmth seemed due
consequence wounding, unlikely recommend
suit.

In spite deeply-rooted dislike, could insensible
compliment man's affection, though intentions
vary instant, first sorry pain
receive; till, roused resentment subsequent language,
lost compassion anger. She tried, however, compose
answer patience, done. He concluded
representing strength attachment which, spite
endeavours, found impossible conquer;
expressing hope would rewarded acceptance
hand. As said this, could easily see doubt
favourable answer. He _spoke_ apprehension anxiety,
countenance expressed real security. Such circumstance could
exasperate farther, and, ceased, colour rose
cheeks, said:

"In cases this, is, I believe, established mode
express sense obligation sentiments avowed, however
unequally may returned. It natural obligation
felt, I could _feel_ gratitude, I would thank you. But I
cannot--I never desired good opinion, certainly
bestowed unwillingly. I sorry occasioned pain
anyone. It unconsciously done, however, I hope
short duration. The feelings which, tell me, long prevented
acknowledgment regard, little difficulty
overcoming explanation."

Mr. Darcy, leaning mantelpiece eyes fixed
face, seemed catch words less resentment
surprise. His complexion became pale anger, disturbance
mind visible every feature. He struggling
appearance composure, would open lips till believed
attained it. The pause Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful. At length, voice forced calmness, said:

"And reply I honour expecting!
I might, perhaps, wish informed why, little _endeavour_
civility, I thus rejected. But small importance."

"I might well inquire," replied she, "why evident desire
offending insulting me, chose tell liked
will, reason, even character?
Was excuse incivility, I _was_ uncivil? But I
provocations. You know I have. Had feelings decided
you--had indifferent, even favourable,
think consideration would tempt accept man
means ruining, perhaps ever, happiness
beloved sister?"

As pronounced words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; emotion
short, listened without attempting interrupt
continued:

"I every reason world think ill you. No motive
excuse unjust ungenerous part acted _there_. You dare not,
cannot deny, principal, means
dividing other--of exposing one censure
world caprice instability, derision
disappointed hopes, involving misery acutest
kind."

She paused, saw slight indignation listening
air proved wholly unmoved feeling remorse.
He even looked smile affected incredulity.

"Can deny done it?" repeated.

With assumed tranquillity replied: "I wish denying
I everything power separate friend
sister, I rejoice success. Towards _him_ I
kinder towards myself."

Elizabeth disdained appearance noticing civil reflection,
meaning escape, likely conciliate her.

"But merely affair," continued, "on dislike
founded. Long taken place opinion
decided. Your character unfolded recital I received
many months ago Mr. Wickham. On subject,
say? In imaginary act friendship defend yourself?
misrepresentation impose upon others?"

"You take eager interest gentleman's concerns," said Darcy,
less tranquil tone, heightened colour.

"Who knows misfortunes been, help feeling
interest him?"

"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, misfortunes
great indeed."

"And infliction," cried Elizabeth energy. "You reduced
present state poverty--comparative poverty. You
withheld advantages must know designed
him. You deprived best years life independence
less due desert. You done this!
yet treat mention misfortune contempt
ridicule."

"And this," cried Darcy, walked quick steps across room,
"is opinion me! This estimation hold me!
I thank explaining fully. My faults, according
calculation, heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping
walk, turning towards her, "these offenses might
overlooked, pride hurt honest confession
scruples long prevented forming serious design. These
bitter accusations might suppressed, I, greater
policy, concealed struggles, flattered belief
impelled unqualified, unalloyed inclination; reason,
reflection, everything. But disguise every sort abhorrence.
Nor I ashamed feelings I related. They natural
just. Could expect rejoice inferiority
connections?--to congratulate hope relations, whose
condition life decidedly beneath own?"

Elizabeth felt growing angry every moment; yet tried
utmost speak composure said:

"You mistaken, Mr. Darcy, suppose mode
declaration affected way, spared concern
I might felt refusing you, behaved
gentlemanlike manner."

She saw start this, said nothing, continued:

"You could made offer hand possible way
would tempted accept it."

Again astonishment obvious; looked
expression mingled incredulity mortification. She went on:

"From beginning--from first moment, I may almost say--of
acquaintance you, manners, impressing fullest
belief arrogance, conceit, selfish disdain
feelings others, form groundwork
disapprobation succeeding events built immovable
dislike; I known month I felt
last man world I could ever prevailed marry."

"You said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend
feelings, ashamed been.
Forgive taken much time, accept best
wishes health happiness."

And words hastily left room, Elizabeth heard
next moment open front door quit house.

The tumult mind, painfully great. She knew
support herself, actual weakness sat cried
half-an-hour. Her astonishment, reflected passed,
increased every review it. That receive offer
marriage Mr. Darcy! That love
many months! So much love wish marry spite
objections made prevent friend's marrying
sister, must appear least equal force
case--was almost incredible! It gratifying inspired
unconsciously strong affection. But pride, abominable
pride--his shameless avowal done respect
Jane--his unpardonable assurance acknowledging, though could
justify it, unfeeling manner mentioned Mr.
Wickham, cruelty towards attempted deny, soon
overcame pity consideration attachment
moment excited. She continued agitated reflections till
sound Lady Catherine's carriage made feel unequal
encounter Charlotte's observation, hurried away room.



Chapter 35


Elizabeth awoke next morning thoughts meditations
length closed eyes. She could yet recover
surprise happened; impossible think anything
else; and, totally indisposed employment, resolved, soon
breakfast, indulge air exercise. She proceeding
directly favourite walk, recollection Mr. Darcy's
sometimes coming stopped her, instead entering park,
turned lane, led farther turnpike-road. The
park paling still boundary one side, soon passed one
gates ground.

After walking two three times along part lane,
tempted, pleasantness morning, stop gates
look park. The five weeks passed Kent
made great difference country, every day adding
verdure early trees. She point continuing walk,
caught glimpse gentleman within sort grove
edged park; moving way; and, fearful Mr.
Darcy, directly retreating. But person advanced
near enough see her, stepping forward eagerness, pronounced
name. She turned away; hearing called, though
voice proved Mr. Darcy, moved towards
gate. He time reached also, and, holding letter,
instinctively took, said, look haughty composure,
"I walking grove time hope meeting you.
Will honour reading letter?" And then,
slight bow, turned plantation, soon sight.

With expectation pleasure, strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened letter, and, still increasing wonder,
perceived envelope containing two sheets letter-paper, written
quite through, close hand. The envelope likewise
full. Pursuing way along lane, began it. It dated
Rosings, eight o'clock morning, follows:--

"Be alarmed, madam, receiving letter, apprehension
containing repetition sentiments renewal
offers last night disgusting you. I write without
intention paining you, humbling myself, dwelling wishes
which, happiness both, cannot soon forgotten;
effort formation perusal letter must occasion,
spared, character required written
read. You must, therefore, pardon freedom I demand
attention; feelings, I know, bestow unwillingly, I
demand justice.

"Two offenses different nature, means equal
magnitude, last night laid charge. The first mentioned was,
that, regardless sentiments either, I detached Mr. Bingley
sister, other, I had, defiance various
claims, defiance honour humanity, ruined immediate
prosperity blasted prospects Mr. Wickham. Wilfully
wantonly thrown companion youth, acknowledged
favourite father, young man scarcely
dependence patronage, brought expect
exertion, would depravity, separation two young
persons, whose affection could growth weeks, could
bear comparison. But severity blame last
night liberally bestowed, respecting circumstance, I shall hope
future secured, following account actions
motives read. If, explanation them,
due myself, I necessity relating feelings
may offensive yours, I say I sorry. The necessity
must obeyed, apology would absurd.

"I long Hertfordshire, I saw, common
others, Bingley preferred elder sister young
woman country. But till evening dance
Netherfield I apprehension feeling serious
attachment. I often seen love before. At ball, I
honour dancing you, I first made acquainted, Sir
William Lucas's accidental information, Bingley's attentions
sister given rise general expectation marriage.
He spoke certain event, time alone could
undecided. From moment I observed friend's behaviour
attentively; I could perceive partiality Miss
Bennet beyond I ever witnessed him. Your sister I also
watched. Her look manners open, cheerful, engaging ever,
without symptom peculiar regard, I remained convinced
evening's scrutiny, though received attentions
pleasure, invite participation
sentiment. If _you_ mistaken here, _I_ must
error. Your superior knowledge sister must make latter
probable. If so, I misled error inflict
pain her, resentment unreasonable. But I shall
scruple assert, serenity sister's countenance
air might given acute observer conviction
that, however amiable temper, heart likely
easily touched. That I desirous believing indifferent
certain--but I venture say investigation decisions
usually influenced hopes fears. I believe
indifferent I wished it; I believed impartial
conviction, truly I wished reason. My objections
marriage merely I last night acknowledged
utmost force passion put aside, case; want
connection could great evil friend me. But
causes repugnance; causes which, though still
existing, existing equal degree instances, I
endeavoured forget, immediately
me. These causes must stated, though briefly. The situation
mother's family, though objectionable, nothing comparison
total want propriety frequently, almost uniformly betrayed
herself, three younger sisters, occasionally even
father. Pardon me. It pains offend you. But amidst concern
defects nearest relations, displeasure
representation them, let give consolation consider that,
conducted avoid share like censure,
praise less generally bestowed elder sister,
honourable sense disposition both. I say
farther passed evening, opinion parties
confirmed, every inducement heightened could led
before, preserve friend I esteemed unhappy
connection. He left Netherfield London, day following,
you, I certain, remember, design soon returning.

"The part I acted explained. His sisters' uneasiness
equally excited own; coincidence feeling
soon discovered, and, alike sensible time lost
detaching brother, shortly resolved joining directly
London. We accordingly went--and I readily engaged office
pointing friend certain evils choice. I
described, enforced earnestly. But, however remonstrance
might staggered delayed determination, I suppose
would ultimately prevented marriage,
seconded assurance I hesitated giving,
sister's indifference. He believed return
affection sincere, equal regard. But Bingley great
natural modesty, stronger dependence judgement
own. To convince him, therefore, deceived himself,
difficult point. To persuade returning
Hertfordshire, conviction given, scarcely
work moment. I cannot blame done thus much. There
one part conduct whole affair I
reflect satisfaction; I condescended adopt
measures art far conceal sister's
town. I knew myself, known Miss Bingley;
brother even yet ignorant it. That might met without
ill consequence perhaps probable; regard appear
enough extinguished see without danger. Perhaps
concealment, disguise beneath me; done, however,
done best. On subject I nothing say,
apology offer. If I wounded sister's feelings,
unknowingly done though motives governed may
naturally appear insufficient, I yet learnt condemn
them.

"With respect other, weighty accusation, injured
Mr. Wickham, I refute laying whole
connection family. Of _particularly_ accused I
ignorant; truth I shall relate, I summon
one witness undoubted veracity.

"Mr. Wickham son respectable man, many
years management Pemberley estates, whose good
conduct discharge trust naturally inclined father
service him; George Wickham, godson,
kindness therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported
school, afterwards Cambridge--most important assistance,
father, always poor extravagance wife, would
unable give gentleman's education. My father
fond young man's society, whose manners always engaging;
also highest opinion him, hoping church would
profession, intended provide it. As myself,
many, many years since I first began think different
manner. The vicious propensities--the want principle,
careful guard knowledge best friend, could escape
observation young man nearly age himself,
opportunities seeing unguarded moments, Mr.
Darcy could have. Here I shall give pain--to degree
tell. But whatever may sentiments Mr. Wickham
created, suspicion nature shall prevent
unfolding real character--it adds even another motive.

"My excellent father died five years ago; attachment
Mr. Wickham last steady, particularly
recommended me, promote advancement best manner
profession might allow--and took orders, desired
valuable family living might soon became vacant. There
also legacy one thousand pounds. His father long
survive mine, within half year events, Mr. Wickham
wrote inform that, finally resolved taking orders,
hoped I think unreasonable expect
immediate pecuniary advantage, lieu preferment,
could benefited. He intention, added, studying
law, I must aware interest one thousand pounds would
insufficient support therein. I rather wished, believed
sincere; but, rate, perfectly ready accede
proposal. I knew Mr. Wickham ought clergyman;
business therefore soon settled--he resigned claim assistance
church, possible could ever situation
receive it, accepted return three thousand pounds. All connection
us seemed dissolved. I thought ill invite
Pemberley, admit society town. In town I believe chiefly
lived, studying law mere pretence, free
restraint, life life idleness dissipation.
For three years I heard little him; decease
incumbent living designed him, applied
letter presentation. His circumstances, assured
me, I difficulty believing it, exceedingly bad. He
found law unprofitable study, absolutely
resolved ordained, I would present living
question--of trusted could little doubt,
well assured I person provide for, I could
forgotten revered father's intentions. You hardly blame
refusing comply entreaty, resisting every
repetition it. His resentment proportion distress
circumstances--and doubtless violent abuse
others reproaches myself. After period every
appearance acquaintance dropped. How lived I know not. But
last summer painfully obtruded notice.

"I must mention circumstance I would wish forget myself,
obligation less present induce unfold
human being. Having said thus much, I feel doubt
secrecy. My sister, ten years junior, left
guardianship mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, myself.
About year ago, taken school, establishment formed
London; last summer went lady presided
it, Ramsgate; thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly
design; proved prior acquaintance
Mrs. Younge, whose character unhappily deceived;
connivance aid, far recommended Georgiana,
whose affectionate heart retained strong impression kindness
child, persuaded believe love,
consent elopement. She fifteen, must
excuse; stating imprudence, I happy add, I owed
knowledge herself. I joined unexpectedly day two
intended elopement, Georgiana, unable support
idea grieving offending brother almost looked
father, acknowledged whole me. You may imagine I felt
I acted. Regard sister's credit feelings prevented
public exposure; I wrote Mr. Wickham, left place
immediately, Mrs. Younge course removed charge. Mr.
Wickham's chief object unquestionably sister's fortune,
thirty thousand pounds; I cannot help supposing hope
revenging strong inducement. His revenge would
complete indeed.

"This, madam, faithful narrative every event
concerned together; absolutely reject
false, will, I hope, acquit henceforth cruelty towards Mr.
Wickham. I know manner, form falsehood
imposed you; success perhaps wondered
at. Ignorant previously everything concerning either,
detection could power, suspicion certainly
inclination.

"You may possibly wonder told last night;
I master enough know could ought
revealed. For truth everything related, I appeal
particularly testimony Colonel Fitzwilliam, who,
near relationship constant intimacy, and, still more, one
executors father's will, unavoidably acquainted
every particular transactions. If abhorrence _me_
make _my_ assertions valueless, cannot prevented
cause confiding cousin; may
possibility consulting him, I shall endeavour find
opportunity putting letter hands course
morning. I add, God bless you.

If Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy gave letter, expect
contain renewal offers, formed expectation
contents. But were, may well supposed eagerly
went them, contrariety emotion excited.
Her feelings read scarcely defined. With amazement
first understand believed apology power;
steadfastly persuaded, could explanation
give, sense shame would conceal. With strong
prejudice everything might say, began account
happened Netherfield. She read eagerness hardly
left power comprehension, impatience knowing
next sentence might bring, incapable attending sense
one eyes. His belief sister's insensibility
instantly resolved false; account real, worst
objections match, made angry wish
justice. He expressed regret done satisfied
her; style penitent, haughty. It pride
insolence.

But subject succeeded account Mr. Wickham--when
read somewhat clearer attention relation events which,
true, must overthrow every cherished opinion worth,
bore alarming affinity history himself--her
feelings yet acutely painful difficult definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, even horror, oppressed her. She wished
discredit entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must false!
This cannot be! This must grossest falsehood!"--and
gone whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything
last page two, put hastily away, protesting would
regard it, would never look again.

In perturbed state mind, thoughts could rest
nothing, walked on; would do; half minute letter
unfolded again, collecting well could,
began mortifying perusal related Wickham,
commanded far examine meaning every sentence.
The account connection Pemberley family exactly
related himself; kindness late Mr. Darcy, though
known extent, agreed equally well
words. So far recital confirmed other; came
will, difference great. What Wickham said living
fresh memory, recalled words,
impossible feel gross duplicity one side
other; and, moments, flattered wishes
err. But read re-read closest attention,
particulars immediately following Wickham's resigning pretensions
living, receiving lieu considerable sum three
thousand pounds, forced hesitate. She put
letter, weighed every circumstance meant
impartiality--deliberated probability statement--but
little success. On sides assertion. Again read
on; every line proved clearly affair,
believed impossible contrivance could represent
render Mr. Darcy's conduct less infamous, capable
turn must make entirely blameless throughout whole.

The extravagance general profligacy scrupled lay
Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; so, could
bring proof injustice. She never heard
entrance ----shire Militia, engaged
persuasion young man who, meeting accidentally town,
renewed slight acquaintance. Of former way life
nothing known Hertfordshire told himself. As
real character, information power,
never felt wish inquiring. His countenance, voice, manner
established possession every virtue. She tried
recollect instance goodness, distinguished trait
integrity benevolence, might rescue attacks
Mr. Darcy; least, predominance virtue, atone
casual errors would endeavour class Mr. Darcy
described idleness vice many years' continuance. But
recollection befriended her. She could see instantly
her, every charm air address; could remember
substantial good general approbation neighbourhood,
regard social powers gained mess. After
pausing point considerable while, continued
read. But, alas! story followed, designs Miss
Darcy, received confirmation passed Colonel
Fitzwilliam morning before; last
referred truth every particular Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from previously received information
near concern cousin's affairs, whose character
reason question. At one time almost resolved applying
him, idea checked awkwardness application,
length wholly banished conviction Mr. Darcy would never
hazarded proposal, well assured
cousin's corroboration.

She perfectly remembered everything passed conversation
Wickham herself, first evening Mr. Phillips's.
Many expressions still fresh memory. She _now_
struck impropriety communications stranger,
wondered escaped before. She saw indelicacy putting
forward done, inconsistency professions
conduct. She remembered boasted fear
seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave country,
_he_ stand ground; yet avoided Netherfield ball
next week. She remembered also that, till Netherfield
family quitted country, told story one
herself; removal everywhere discussed;
reserves, scruples sinking Mr. Darcy's
character, though assured respect father would
always prevent exposing son.

How differently everything appear concerned!
His attentions Miss King consequence views solely
hatefully mercenary; mediocrity fortune proved longer
moderation wishes, eagerness grasp anything.
His behaviour could tolerable motive;
either deceived regard fortune, gratifying
vanity encouraging preference believed
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle favour grew fainter
fainter; farther justification Mr. Darcy, could
allow Mr. Bingley, questioned Jane, long ago
asserted blamelessness affair; proud repulsive
manners, never, whole course
acquaintance--an acquaintance latterly brought much
together, given sort intimacy ways--seen anything
betrayed unprincipled unjust--anything spoke
irreligious immoral habits; among connections
esteemed valued--that even Wickham allowed merit
brother, often heard speak affectionately
sister prove capable _some_ amiable feeling;
actions Mr. Wickham represented them, gross violation
everything right could hardly concealed world;
friendship person capable it, amiable man
Mr. Bingley, incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed herself. Of neither Darcy Wickham
could think without feeling blind, partial, prejudiced,
absurd.

"How despicably I acted!" cried; "I, prided
discernment! I, valued abilities!
often disdained generous candour sister, gratified
vanity useless blameable mistrust! How humiliating
discovery! Yet, humiliation! Had I love, I could
wretchedly blind! But vanity, love,
folly. Pleased preference one, offended neglect
other, beginning acquaintance, I courted
prepossession ignorance, driven reason away, either
concerned. Till moment I never knew myself."

From Jane--from Jane Bingley, thoughts line
soon brought recollection Mr. Darcy's explanation
_there_ appeared insufficient, read again. Widely
different effect second perusal. How could deny
credit assertions one instance, obliged
give other? He declared totally unsuspicious
sister's attachment; could help remembering Charlotte's
opinion always been. Neither could deny justice
description Jane. She felt Jane's feelings, though fervent,
little displayed, constant complacency air
manner often united great sensibility.

When came part letter family
mentioned terms mortifying, yet merited reproach, sense
shame severe. The justice charge struck forcibly
denial, circumstances particularly alluded
passed Netherfield ball, confirming first
disapprobation, could made stronger impression mind
hers.

The compliment sister unfelt. It soothed,
could console contempt thus
self-attracted rest family; considered
Jane's disappointment fact work nearest
relations, reflected materially credit must hurt
impropriety conduct, felt depressed beyond anything
ever known before.

After wandering along lane two hours, giving way every
variety thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,
reconciling herself, well could, change sudden
important, fatigue, recollection long absence, made
length return home; entered house wish
appearing cheerful usual, resolution repressing
reflections must make unfit conversation.

She immediately told two gentlemen Rosings
called absence; Mr. Darcy, minutes, take
leave--but Colonel Fitzwilliam sitting least
hour, hoping return, almost resolving walk
till could found. Elizabeth could _affect_ concern
missing him; really rejoiced it. Colonel Fitzwilliam
longer object; could think letter.



Chapter 37


The two gentlemen left Rosings next morning, Mr. Collins
waiting near lodges, make parting obeisance,
able bring home pleasing intelligence, appearing
good health, tolerable spirits could expected,
melancholy scene lately gone Rosings. To Rosings
hastened, console Lady Catherine daughter; return
brought back, great satisfaction, message ladyship,
importing felt dull make desirous
dine her.

Elizabeth could see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,
chosen it, might time presented
future niece; could think, without smile,
ladyship's indignation would been. "What would said?
would behaved?" questions amused herself.

Their first subject diminution Rosings party. "I assure
you, I feel exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe one
feels loss friends much I do. But I particularly
attached young men, know much attached
me! They excessively sorry go! But always are. The
dear Colonel rallied spirits tolerably till last; Darcy
seemed feel acutely, more, I think, last year. His
attachment Rosings certainly increases."

Mr. Collins compliment, allusion throw here,
kindly smiled mother daughter.

Lady Catherine observed, dinner, Miss Bennet seemed
spirits, immediately accounting herself, supposing
like go home soon, added:

"But case, must write mother beg
may stay little longer. Mrs. Collins glad
company, I sure."

"I much obliged ladyship kind invitation," replied
Elizabeth, "but power accept it. I must town
next Saturday."

"Why, rate, six weeks. I expected
stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins came. There
occasion going soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
spare another fortnight."

"But father cannot. He wrote last week hurry return."

"Oh! father course may spare you, mother can. Daughters
never much consequence father. And stay
another _month_ complete, power take one
far London, I going early June, week;
Dawson object barouche-box, good room
one you--and indeed, weather happen cool, I
object taking both, neither large."

"You kindness, madam; I believe must abide
original plan."

Lady Catherine seemed resigned. "Mrs. Collins, must send servant
them. You know I always speak mind, I cannot bear idea
two young women travelling post themselves. It highly improper.
You must contrive send somebody. I greatest dislike
world sort thing. Young women always properly
guarded attended, according situation life. When
niece Georgiana went Ramsgate last summer, I made point
two men-servants go her. Miss Darcy, daughter
Mr. Darcy, Pemberley, Lady Anne, could appeared
propriety different manner. I excessively attentive
things. You must send John young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I
glad occurred mention it; would really
discreditable _you_ let go alone."

"My uncle send servant us."

"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps man-servant, he? I glad
somebody thinks things. Where shall change horses?
Oh! Bromley, course. If mention name Bell,
attended to."

Lady Catherine many questions ask respecting journey,
answer herself, attention necessary,
Elizabeth believed lucky her; or, mind
occupied, might forgotten was. Reflection must
reserved solitary hours; whenever alone, gave way
greatest relief; day went without solitary
walk, might indulge delight unpleasant
recollections.

Mr. Darcy's letter fair way soon knowing heart. She
studied every sentence; feelings towards writer
times widely different. When remembered style address,
still full indignation; considered unjustly
condemned upbraided him, anger turned
herself; disappointed feelings became object compassion.
His attachment excited gratitude, general character respect;
could approve him; could moment repent refusal,
feel slightest inclination ever see again. In past
behaviour, constant source vexation regret;
unhappy defects family, subject yet heavier chagrin.
They hopeless remedy. Her father, contented laughing
them, would never exert restrain wild giddiness
youngest daughters; mother, manners far right
herself, entirely insensible evil. Elizabeth frequently
united Jane endeavour check imprudence Catherine
Lydia; supported mother's indulgence,
chance could improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, completely Lydia's guidance, always
affronted advice; Lydia, self-willed careless, would
scarcely give hearing. They ignorant, idle, vain. While
officer Meryton, would flirt him;
Meryton within walk Longbourn, would going
forever.

Anxiety Jane's behalf another prevailing concern; Mr. Darcy's
explanation, restoring Bingley former good opinion,
heightened sense Jane lost. His affection proved
sincere, conduct cleared blame, unless
could attach implicitness confidence friend. How
grievous thought that, situation desirable every
respect, replete advantage, promising happiness, Jane
deprived, folly indecorum family!

When recollections added development Wickham's
character, may easily believed happy spirits
seldom depressed before, much affected make
almost impossible appear tolerably cheerful.

Their engagements Rosings frequent last week
stay first. The last evening spent
there; ladyship inquired minutely particulars
journey, gave directions best method packing,
urgent necessity placing gowns right
way, Maria thought obliged, return, undo
work morning, pack trunk afresh.

When parted, Lady Catherine, great condescension, wished
good journey, invited come Hunsford next year;
Miss de Bourgh exerted far curtsey hold
hand both.



Chapter 38


On Saturday morning Elizabeth Mr. Collins met breakfast
minutes others appeared; took opportunity
paying parting civilities deemed indispensably necessary.

"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins yet
expressed sense kindness coming us; I
certain leave house without receiving thanks
it. The favour company much felt, I assure you. We
know little tempt anyone humble abode. Our plain
manner living, small rooms domestics, little
see world, must make Hunsford extremely dull young lady like
yourself; I hope believe us grateful condescension,
done everything power prevent spending
time unpleasantly."

Elizabeth eager thanks assurances happiness. She
spent six weeks great enjoyment; pleasure
Charlotte, kind attentions received, must make _her_
feel obliged. Mr. Collins gratified, smiling
solemnity replied:

"It gives great pleasure hear passed time
disagreeably. We certainly done best; fortunately
power introduce superior society, and,
connection Rosings, frequent means varying
humble home scene, I think may flatter Hunsford
visit cannot entirely irksome. Our situation regard
Lady Catherine's family indeed sort extraordinary advantage
blessing boast. You see footing are. You
see continually engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
that, disadvantages humble parsonage, I
think anyone abiding object compassion,
sharers intimacy Rosings."

Words insufficient elevation feelings;
obliged walk room, Elizabeth tried unite civility
truth short sentences.

"You may, fact, carry favourable report us
Hertfordshire, dear cousin. I flatter least
able so. Lady Catherine's great attentions Mrs. Collins
daily witness of; altogether I trust appear
friend drawn unfortunate--but point
well silent. Only let assure you, dear Miss Elizabeth,
I heart cordially wish equal felicity
marriage. My dear Charlotte I one mind one way
thinking. There everything remarkable resemblance
character ideas us. We seem designed
other."

Elizabeth could safely say great happiness
case, equal sincerity could add, firmly believed
rejoiced domestic comforts. She sorry, however,
recital interrupted lady sprang.
Poor Charlotte! melancholy leave society! But
chosen eyes open; though evidently regretting
visitors go, seem ask compassion. Her
home housekeeping, parish poultry,
dependent concerns, yet lost charms.

At length chaise arrived, trunks fastened on, parcels
placed within, pronounced ready. After affectionate
parting friends, Elizabeth attended carriage
Mr. Collins, walked garden commissioning
best respects family, forgetting thanks
kindness received Longbourn winter,
compliments Mr. Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He handed
in, Maria followed, door point closed,
suddenly reminded them, consternation,
hitherto forgotten leave message ladies Rosings.

"But," added, "you course wish humble respects
delivered them, grateful thanks kindness
here."

Elizabeth made objection; door allowed shut,
carriage drove off.

"Good gracious!" cried Maria, minutes' silence, "it seems
day two since first came! yet many things
happened!"

"A great many indeed," said companion sigh.

"We dined nine times Rosings, besides drinking tea twice!
How much I shall tell!"

Elizabeth added privately, "And much I shall conceal!"

Their journey performed without much conversation, alarm;
within four hours leaving Hunsford reached Mr. Gardiner's
house, remain days.

Jane looked well, Elizabeth little opportunity studying
spirits, amidst various engagements kindness
aunt reserved them. But Jane go home her,
Longbourn would leisure enough observation.

It without effort, meanwhile, could wait even
Longbourn, told sister Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know
power revealing would exceedingly astonish
Jane, must, time, highly gratify whatever
vanity yet able reason away, temptation
openness nothing could conquered state indecision
remained extent communicate;
fear, entered subject, hurried
repeating something Bingley might grieve sister
further.



Chapter 39


It second week May, three young ladies set
together Gracechurch Street town ----, Hertfordshire;
and, drew near appointed inn Mr. Bennet's carriage
meet them, quickly perceived, token coachman's
punctuality, Kitty Lydia looking dining-room stairs.
These two girls hour place, happily employed
visiting opposite milliner, watching sentinel guard,
dressing salad cucumber.

After welcoming sisters, triumphantly displayed table set
cold meat inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"Is nice? Is agreeable surprise?"

"And mean treat all," added Lydia, "but must lend us
money, spent shop there." Then, showing
purchases--"Look here, I bought bonnet. I think
pretty; I thought I might well buy not. I shall
pull pieces soon I get home, see I make
better."

And sisters abused ugly, added, perfect
unconcern, "Oh! two three much uglier shop;
I bought prettier-coloured satin trim fresh, I
think tolerable. Besides, much signify
one wears summer, ----shire left Meryton,
going fortnight."

"Are indeed!" cried Elizabeth, greatest satisfaction.

"They going encamped near Brighton; I want papa
take us summer! It would delicious scheme;
I dare say would hardly cost anything all. Mamma would like
go things! Only think miserable summer else shall
have!"

"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would delightful scheme indeed,
completely us once. Good Heaven! Brighton, whole
campful soldiers, us, overset already one poor
regiment militia, monthly balls Meryton!"

"Now I got news you," said Lydia, sat
table. "What think? It excellent news--capital news--and
certain person like!"

Jane Elizabeth looked other, waiter told need
stay. Lydia laughed, said:

"Aye, like formality discretion. You thought
waiter must hear, cared! I dare say often hears worse
things said I going say. But ugly fellow! I glad
gone. I never saw long chin life. Well,
news; dear Wickham; good waiter, not?
There danger Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's you! She
gone uncle Liverpool: gone stay. Wickham safe."

"And Mary King safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe connection
imprudent fortune."

"She great fool going away, liked him."

"But I hope strong attachment either side," said Jane.

"I sure _his_. I answer it, never cared
three straws her--who could nasty little freckled
thing?"

Elizabeth shocked think that, however incapable
coarseness _expression_ herself, coarseness _sentiment_
little breast harboured fancied liberal!

As soon ate, elder ones paid, carriage
ordered; contrivance, whole party,
boxes, work-bags, parcels, unwelcome addition Kitty's
Lydia's purchases, seated it.

"How nicely crammed in," cried Lydia. "I glad I bought
bonnet, fun another bandbox! Well,
let us quite comfortable snug, talk laugh way
home. And first place, let us hear happened
since went away. Have seen pleasant men? Have
flirting? I great hopes one would got husband
came back. Jane quite old maid soon, I declare.
She almost three-and-twenty! Lord, ashamed I
married three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants
get husbands, can't think. She says Lizzy better taken Mr.
Collins; _I_ think would fun it. Lord!
I like married you; I would
chaperon balls. Dear me! good piece
fun day Colonel Forster's. Kitty spend
day there, Mrs. Forster promised little dance
evening; (by bye, Mrs. Forster _such_ friends!)
asked two Harringtons come, Harriet ill, Pen
forced come herself; then, think did? We
dressed Chamberlayne woman's clothes purpose pass
lady, think fun! Not soul knew it, Colonel Mrs.
Forster, Kitty me, except aunt, forced borrow
one gowns; cannot imagine well looked! When Denny,
Wickham, Pratt, two three men came in,
know least. Lord! I laughed! Mrs.
Forster. I thought I died. And _that_ made men suspect
something, soon found matter."

With kinds histories parties good jokes,
Lydia, assisted Kitty's hints additions, endeavour amuse
companions way Longbourn. Elizabeth listened little
could, escaping frequent mention Wickham's name.

Their reception home kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced see Jane
undiminished beauty; dinner Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily Elizabeth:

"I glad come back, Lizzy."

Their party dining-room large, almost Lucases
came meet Maria hear news; various subjects
occupied them: Lady Lucas inquiring Maria, welfare
poultry eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet doubly engaged, one
hand collecting account present fashions Jane, sat
way her, and, other, retailing younger
Lucases; Lydia, voice rather louder person's,
enumerating various pleasures morning anybody
would hear her.

"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish gone us, fun!
As went along, Kitty I drew blinds, pretended
nobody coach; I gone way, Kitty
sick; got George, I think behaved
handsomely, treated three nicest cold
luncheon world, would gone, would treated
too. And came away fun! I thought never
got coach. I ready die laughter. And
merry way home! talked laughed loud,
anybody might heard us ten miles off!"

To Mary gravely replied, "Far me, dear sister,
depreciate pleasures! They would doubtless congenial
generality female minds. But I confess would charms
_me_--I infinitely prefer book."

But answer Lydia heard word. She seldom listened
anybody half minute, never attended Mary all.

In afternoon Lydia urgent rest girls walk
Meryton, see everybody went on; Elizabeth steadily
opposed scheme. It said Miss Bennets could
home half day pursuit officers.
There another reason opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.
Wickham again, resolved avoid long possible. The
comfort _her_ regiment's approaching removal indeed beyond
expression. In fortnight go--and gone, hoped
could nothing plague account.

She many hours home found Brighton
scheme, Lydia given hint inn,
frequent discussion parents. Elizabeth saw directly
father smallest intention yielding; answers
time vague equivocal, mother, though often
disheartened, never yet despaired succeeding last.



Chapter 40


Elizabeth's impatience acquaint Jane happened could
longer overcome; length, resolving suppress every
particular sister concerned, preparing
surprised, related next morning chief scene
Mr. Darcy herself.

Miss Bennet's astonishment soon lessened strong sisterly
partiality made admiration Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; surprise shortly lost feelings. She
sorry Mr. Darcy delivered sentiments manner
little suited recommend them; still grieved
unhappiness sister's refusal must given him.

"His sure succeeding wrong," said she, "and certainly
ought appeared; consider much must increase
disappointment!"

"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I heartily sorry him;
feelings, probably soon drive away regard me.
You blame me, however, refusing him?"

"Blame you! Oh, no."

"But blame spoken warmly Wickham?"

"No--I know wrong saying did."

"But _will_ know it, I tell happened next
day."

She spoke letter, repeating whole contents far
concerned George Wickham. What stroke poor Jane!
would willingly gone world without believing
much wickedness existed whole race mankind,
collected one individual. Nor Darcy's vindication, though
grateful feelings, capable consoling discovery.
Most earnestly labour prove probability error,
seek clear one without involving other.

"This do," said Elizabeth; "you never able make
good anything. Take choice, must satisfied
one. There quantity merit them;
enough make one good sort man; late shifting
pretty much. For part, I inclined believe Darcy's;
shall choose."

It time, however, smile could extorted Jane.

"I know I shocked," said she. "Wickham
bad! It almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy,
consider must suffered. Such disappointment!
knowledge ill opinion, too! relate thing
sister! It really distressing. I sure must feel
so."

"Oh! no, regret compassion done away seeing
full both. I know ample justice, I
growing every moment unconcerned indifferent. Your profusion
makes saving; lament much longer, heart
light feather."

"Poor Wickham! expression goodness
countenance! openness gentleness manner!"

"There certainly great mismanagement education
two young men. One got goodness,
appearance it."

"I never thought Mr. Darcy deficient _appearance_
used do."

"And yet I meant uncommonly clever taking decided dislike
him, without reason. It spur one's genius,
opening wit, dislike kind. One may continually
abusive without saying anything just; one cannot always laughing
man without stumbling something witty."

"Lizzy, first read letter, I sure could treat
matter now."

"Indeed, I could not. I uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
one speak I felt, Jane comfort say
I weak vain nonsensical I knew I
had! Oh! I wanted you!"

"How unfortunate used strong expressions
speaking Wickham Mr. Darcy, _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."

"Certainly. But misfortune speaking bitterness
natural consequence prejudices I encouraging. There
one point I want advice. I want told whether I
ought, ought not, make acquaintances general understand
Wickham's character."

Miss Bennet paused little, replied, "Surely
occasion exposing dreadfully. What opinion?"

"That ought attempted. Mr. Darcy authorised
make communication public. On contrary, every particular
relative sister meant kept much possible
myself; I endeavour undeceive people rest
conduct, believe me? The general prejudice Mr. Darcy
violent, would death half good people
Meryton attempt place amiable light. I equal
it. Wickham soon gone; therefore signify
anyone really is. Some time hence found out,
may laugh stupidity knowing before. At
present I say nothing it."

"You quite right. To errors made public might ruin
ever. He now, perhaps, sorry done, anxious
re-establish character. We must make desperate."

The tumult Elizabeth's mind allayed conversation. She
got rid two secrets weighed fortnight,
certain willing listener Jane, whenever might wish
talk either. But still something lurking behind,
prudence forbade disclosure. She dared relate
half Mr. Darcy's letter, explain sister sincerely
valued friend. Here knowledge one
could partake; sensible nothing less perfect
understanding parties could justify throwing
last encumbrance mystery. "And then," said she, "if
improbable event ever take place, I shall merely able
tell Bingley may tell much agreeable manner himself. The
liberty communication cannot mine till lost value!"

She now, settled home, leisure observe real
state sister's spirits. Jane happy. She still cherished
tender affection Bingley. Having never even fancied
love before, regard warmth first attachment,
and, age disposition, greater steadiness first
attachments often boast; fervently value remembrance,
prefer every man, good sense,
attention feelings friends, requisite check
indulgence regrets must injurious
health tranquillity.

"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what opinion _now_
sad business Jane's? For part, I determined never speak
anybody. I told sister Phillips day. But
I cannot find Jane saw anything London. Well,
undeserving young man--and I suppose there's least
chance world ever getting now. There talk
coming Netherfield summer; I inquired
everybody, too, likely know."

"I believe ever live Netherfield more."

"Oh well! chooses. Nobody wants come. Though I
shall always say used daughter extremely ill; I her, I
would put it. Well, comfort is, I sure Jane
die broken heart; sorry done."

But Elizabeth could receive comfort expectation,
made answer.

"Well, Lizzy," continued mother, soon afterwards, "and
Collinses live comfortable, they? Well, well, I hope
last. And sort table keep? Charlotte
excellent manager, I dare say. If half sharp
mother, saving enough. There nothing extravagant _their_
housekeeping, I dare say."

"No, nothing all."

"A great deal good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _they_
take care outrun income. _They_ never distressed
money. Well, much good may them! And so, I suppose, often
talk Longbourn father dead. They look upon
quite own, I dare say, whenever happens."

"It subject could mention me."

"No; would strange had; I make doubt
often talk themselves. Well, easy
estate lawfully own, much better. I
ashamed one entailed me."



Chapter 41


The first week return soon gone. The second began. It
last regiment's stay Meryton, young ladies
neighbourhood drooping apace. The dejection almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone still able eat, drink,
sleep, pursue usual course employments. Very
frequently reproached insensibility Kitty
Lydia, whose misery extreme, could comprehend
hard-heartedness family.

"Good Heaven! become us? What do?" would
often exclaim bitterness woe. "How smiling so,
Lizzy?"

Their affectionate mother shared grief; remembered
endured similar occasion, five-and-twenty years
ago.

"I sure," said she, "I cried two days together Colonel
Miller's regiment went away. I thought I broken heart."

"I sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.

"If one could go Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet.

"Oh, yes!--if one could go Brighton! But papa
disagreeable."

"A little sea-bathing would set forever."

"And aunt Phillips sure would _me_ great deal good,"
added Kitty.

Such kind lamentations resounding perpetually
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried diverted them; sense
pleasure lost shame. She felt anew justice Mr. Darcy's
objections; never much disposed pardon
interference views friend.

But gloom Lydia's prospect shortly cleared away;
received invitation Mrs. Forster, wife colonel
regiment, accompany Brighton. This invaluable friend
young woman, lately married. A resemblance good humour
good spirits recommended Lydia other,
_three_ months' acquaintance intimate _two_.

The rapture Lydia occasion, adoration Mrs. Forster,
delight Mrs. Bennet, mortification Kitty, scarcely
described. Wholly inattentive sister's feelings, Lydia
flew house restless ecstasy, calling everyone's
congratulations, laughing talking violence ever;
whilst luckless Kitty continued parlour repined fate
terms unreasonable accent peevish.

"I cannot see Mrs. Forster ask _me_ well Lydia,"
said she, "Though I _not_ particular friend. I much
right asked has, too, I two years older."

In vain Elizabeth attempt make reasonable, Jane make
resigned. As Elizabeth herself, invitation far
exciting feelings mother Lydia,
considered death warrant possibility common sense
latter; detestable step must make
known, could help secretly advising father let
go. She represented improprieties Lydia's general
behaviour, little advantage could derive friendship
woman Mrs. Forster, probability yet
imprudent companion Brighton, temptations must
greater home. He heard attentively, said:

"Lydia never easy exposed public
place other, never expect
little expense inconvenience family present
circumstances."

"If aware," said Elizabeth, "of great disadvantage
us must arise public notice Lydia's unguarded
imprudent manner--nay, already arisen it, I sure
would judge differently affair."

"Already arisen?" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, frightened away
lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But cast down. Such
squeamish youths cannot bear connected little absurdity
worth regret. Come, let see list pitiful fellows
kept aloof Lydia's folly."

"Indeed mistaken. I injuries resent. It
particular, general evils, I complaining. Our
importance, respectability world must affected
wild volatility, assurance disdain restraint mark
Lydia's character. Excuse me, I must speak plainly. If you, dear
father, take trouble checking exuberant spirits,
teaching present pursuits business
life, soon beyond reach amendment. Her character
fixed, will, sixteen, determined flirt
ever made family ridiculous; flirt, too,
worst meanest degree flirtation; without attraction beyond
youth tolerable person; and, ignorance emptiness
mind, wholly unable ward portion universal
contempt rage admiration excite. In danger
Kitty also comprehended. She follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! dear father,
suppose possible censured despised wherever
known, sisters often involved
disgrace?"

Mr. Bennet saw whole heart subject,
affectionately taking hand said reply:

"Do make uneasy, love. Wherever Jane known
must respected valued; appear less
advantage couple of--or I may say, three--very silly
sisters. We shall peace Longbourn Lydia go
Brighton. Let go, then. Colonel Forster sensible man,
keep real mischief; luckily poor
object prey anybody. At Brighton less importance
even common flirt here. The officers find
women better worth notice. Let us hope, therefore,
may teach insignificance. At rate, cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorising us lock rest
life."

With answer Elizabeth forced content; opinion
continued same, left disappointed sorry. It
nature, however, increase vexations dwelling
them. She confident performed duty, fret
unavoidable evils, augment anxiety, part
disposition.

Had Lydia mother known substance conference
father, indignation would hardly found expression
united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, visit Brighton comprised
every possibility earthly happiness. She saw, creative eye
fancy, streets gay bathing-place covered officers.
She saw object attention, tens scores
present unknown. She saw glories camp--its tents
stretched forth beauteous uniformity lines, crowded young
gay, dazzling scarlet; and, complete view,
saw seated beneath tent, tenderly flirting least six
officers once.

Had known sister sought tear prospects
realities these, would sensations? They could
understood mother, might felt nearly same.
Lydia's going Brighton consoled melancholy
conviction husband's never intending go himself.

But entirely ignorant passed; raptures
continued, little intermission, day Lydia's leaving
home.

Elizabeth see Mr. Wickham last time. Having
frequently company since return, agitation pretty
well over; agitations formal partiality entirely so. She even
learnt detect, gentleness first delighted
her, affectation sameness disgust weary. In present
behaviour herself, moreover, fresh source displeasure,
inclination soon testified renewing intentions
marked early part acquaintance could serve,
since passed, provoke her. She lost concern
finding thus selected object idle frivolous
gallantry; steadily repressed it, could feel
reproof contained believing, however long, whatever
cause, attentions withdrawn, vanity would gratified,
preference secured time renewal.

On last day regiment's remaining Meryton, dined,
officers, Longbourn; little Elizabeth
disposed part good humour, making
inquiry manner time passed Hunsford,
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's Mr. Darcy's spent three
weeks Rosings, asked him, acquainted former.

He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; moment's
recollection returning smile, replied, formerly seen
often; and, observing gentlemanlike man,
asked liked him. Her answer warmly favour.
With air indifference soon afterwards added:

"How long say Rosings?"

"Nearly three weeks."

"And saw frequently?"

"Yes, almost every day."

"His manners different cousin's."

"Yes, different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance."

"Indeed!" cried Mr. Wickham look escape her. "And
pray, may I ask?--" But checking himself, added, gayer tone, "Is
address improves? Has deigned add aught civility
ordinary style?--for I dare hope," continued lower
serious tone, "that improved essentials."

"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, much
ever was."

While spoke, Wickham looked scarcely knowing whether
rejoice words, distrust meaning. There
something countenance made listen apprehensive
anxious attention, added:

"When I said improved acquaintance, I mean
mind manners state improvement, that,
knowing better, disposition better understood."

Wickham's alarm appeared heightened complexion agitated
look; minutes silent, till, shaking
embarrassment, turned again, said gentlest
accents:

"You, well know feeling towards Mr. Darcy, readily
comprehend sincerely I must rejoice wise enough assume
even _appearance_ right. His pride, direction,
may service, himself, many others, must
deter foul misconduct I suffered by. I
fear sort cautiousness you, I imagine,
alluding, merely adopted visits aunt, whose good
opinion judgement stands much awe. His fear always
operated, I know, together; good deal
imputed wish forwarding match Miss de Bourgh, I
certain much heart."

Elizabeth could repress smile this, answered
slight inclination head. She saw wanted engage
old subject grievances, humour indulge
him. The rest evening passed _appearance_,
side, usual cheerfulness, attempt distinguish
Elizabeth; parted last mutual civility, possibly
mutual desire never meeting again.

When party broke up, Lydia returned Mrs. Forster Meryton,
whence set early next morning. The separation
family rather noisy pathetic. Kitty
one shed tears; weep vexation envy. Mrs.
Bennet diffuse good wishes felicity daughter,
impressive injunctions miss
opportunity enjoying much possible--advice
every reason believe would well attended to;
clamorous happiness Lydia bidding farewell,
gentle adieus sisters uttered without heard.



Chapter 42


Had Elizabeth's opinion drawn family, could
formed pleasing opinion conjugal felicity domestic
comfort. Her father, captivated youth beauty, appearance
good humour youth beauty generally give, married
woman whose weak understanding illiberal mind early
marriage put end real affection her. Respect,
esteem, confidence vanished ever; views
domestic happiness overthrown. But Mr. Bennet
disposition seek comfort disappointment
imprudence brought on, pleasures often
console unfortunate folly vice. He fond
country books; tastes arisen principal
enjoyments. To wife little otherwise indebted,
ignorance folly contributed amusement. This
sort happiness man would general wish owe
wife; powers entertainment wanting, true
philosopher derive benefit given.

Elizabeth, however, never blind impropriety
father's behaviour husband. She always seen pain;
respecting abilities, grateful affectionate treatment
herself, endeavoured forget could overlook,
banish thoughts continual breach conjugal obligation
decorum which, exposing wife contempt
children, highly reprehensible. But never felt
strongly disadvantages must attend children
unsuitable marriage, ever fully aware evils arising
ill-judged direction talents; talents, which, rightly used,
might least preserved respectability daughters, even
incapable enlarging mind wife.

When Elizabeth rejoiced Wickham's departure found little
cause satisfaction loss regiment. Their parties
abroad less varied before, home mother
sister whose constant repinings dullness everything around
threw real gloom domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might time regain natural degree sense, since disturbers
brain removed, sister, whose disposition
greater evil might apprehended, likely hardened
folly assurance situation double danger
watering-place camp. Upon whole, therefore, found,
sometimes found before, event
looking impatient desire not, taking place, bring
satisfaction promised herself. It consequently necessary
name period commencement actual felicity--to
point wishes hopes might fixed,
enjoying pleasure anticipation, console
present, prepare another disappointment. Her tour Lakes
object happiest thoughts; best consolation
uncomfortable hours discontentedness mother
Kitty made inevitable; could included Jane
scheme, every part would perfect.

"But fortunate," thought she, "that I something wish for.
Were whole arrangement complete, disappointment would certain.
But here, carrying one ceaseless source regret
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope expectations
pleasure realised. A scheme every part promises delight
never successful; general disappointment warded
defence little peculiar vexation."

When Lydia went away promised write often minutely
mother Kitty; letters always long expected,
always short. Those mother contained little else
returned library, officers
attended them, seen beautiful ornaments
made quite wild; new gown, new parasol,
would described fully, obliged leave
violent hurry, Mrs. Forster called her, going
camp; correspondence sister, still
less learnt--for letters Kitty, though rather longer,
much full lines words made public.

After first fortnight three weeks absence, health, good
humour, cheerfulness began reappear Longbourn. Everything wore
happier aspect. The families town winter came
back again, summer finery summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
restored usual querulous serenity; and, middle
June, Kitty much recovered able enter Meryton without
tears; event happy promise make Elizabeth hope
following Christmas might tolerably reasonable
mention officer day, unless, cruel malicious
arrangement War Office, another regiment quartered
Meryton.

The time fixed beginning northern tour fast
approaching, fortnight wanting it, letter
arrived Mrs. Gardiner, delayed commencement
curtailed extent. Mr. Gardiner would prevented business
setting till fortnight later July, must London
within month, left short period go
far, see much proposed, least see
leisure comfort built on, obliged give
Lakes, substitute contracted tour, and, according
present plan, go farther northwards Derbyshire. In
county enough seen occupy chief three
weeks; Mrs. Gardiner peculiarly strong attraction. The
town formerly passed years life,
spend days, probably great object
curiosity celebrated beauties Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, Peak.

Elizabeth excessively disappointed; set heart seeing
Lakes, still thought might time enough. But
business satisfied--and certainly temper happy;
soon right again.

With mention Derbyshire many ideas connected. It
impossible see word without thinking Pemberley
owner. "But surely," said she, "I may enter county impunity,
rob petrified spars without perceiving me."

The period expectation doubled. Four weeks pass away
uncle aunt's arrival. But pass away, Mr.
Mrs. Gardiner, four children, length appear
Longbourn. The children, two girls six eight years old, two
younger boys, left particular care
cousin Jane, general favourite, whose steady sense
sweetness temper exactly adapted attending every
way--teaching them, playing them, loving them.

The Gardiners stayed one night Longbourn, set
next morning Elizabeth pursuit novelty amusement.
One enjoyment certain--that suitableness companions;
suitableness comprehended health temper bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness enhance every pleasure--and affection
intelligence, might supply among
disappointments abroad.

It object work give description Derbyshire,
remarkable places route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc.
sufficiently known. A small part Derbyshire present
concern. To little town Lambton, scene Mrs. Gardiner's
former residence, lately learned acquaintance
still remained, bent steps, seen
principal wonders country; within five miles Lambton,
Elizabeth found aunt Pemberley situated. It
direct road, mile two it. In
talking route evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed
inclination see place again. Mr. Gardiner declared
willingness, Elizabeth applied approbation.

"My love, like see place heard
much?" said aunt; "a place, too, many
acquaintances connected. Wickham passed youth there,
know."

Elizabeth distressed. She felt business
Pemberley, obliged assume disinclination seeing it. She
must tired seeing great houses; going
many, really pleasure fine carpets satin curtains.

Mrs. Gardiner abused stupidity. "If merely fine house
richly furnished," said she, "I care myself;
grounds delightful. They finest woods
country."

Elizabeth said more--but mind could acquiesce. The
possibility meeting Mr. Darcy, viewing place, instantly
occurred. It would dreadful! She blushed idea,
thought would better speak openly aunt run
risk. But objections; finally resolved
could last resource, private inquiries
absence family unfavourably answered.

Accordingly, retired night, asked chambermaid
whether Pemberley fine place? name
proprietor? and, little alarm, whether family
summer? A welcome negative followed last question--and
alarms removed, leisure feel great deal
curiosity see house herself; subject revived
next morning, applied to, could readily answer,
proper air indifference, really dislike
scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, go.



Chapter 43


Elizabeth, drove along, watched first appearance
Pemberley Woods perturbation; length turned
lodge, spirits high flutter.

The park large, contained great variety ground. They
entered one lowest points, drove time
beautiful wood stretching wide extent.

Elizabeth's mind full conversation, saw admired
every remarkable spot point view. They gradually ascended
half-a-mile, found top considerable
eminence, wood ceased, eye instantly caught
Pemberley House, situated opposite side valley,
road abruptness wound. It large, handsome stone
building, standing well rising ground, backed ridge
high woody hills; front, stream natural importance
swelled greater, without artificial appearance. Its banks
neither formal falsely adorned. Elizabeth delighted. She
never seen place nature done more, natural
beauty little counteracted awkward taste. They
warm admiration; moment felt
mistress Pemberley might something!

They descended hill, crossed bridge, drove door; and,
examining nearer aspect house, apprehension
meeting owner returned. She dreaded lest chambermaid
mistaken. On applying see place, admitted
hall; Elizabeth, waited housekeeper, leisure
wonder was.

The housekeeper came; respectable-looking elderly woman, much less
fine, civil, notion finding her. They
followed dining-parlour. It large, well proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, slightly surveying it, went
window enjoy prospect. The hill, crowned wood,
descended, receiving increased abruptness distance,
beautiful object. Every disposition ground good;
looked whole scene, river, trees scattered
banks winding valley, far could trace it,
delight. As passed rooms objects taking
different positions; every window beauties
seen. The rooms lofty handsome, furniture suitable
fortune proprietor; Elizabeth saw, admiration
taste, neither gaudy uselessly fine; less
splendour, real elegance, furniture Rosings.

"And place," thought she, "I might mistress! With
rooms I might familiarly acquainted! Instead
viewing stranger, I might rejoiced own,
welcomed visitors uncle aunt. But no,"--recollecting
herself--"that could never be; uncle aunt would lost
me; I allowed invite them."

This lucky recollection--it saved something like
regret.

She longed inquire housekeeper whether master really
absent, courage it. At length however, question
asked uncle; turned away alarm, Mrs.
Reynolds replied was, adding, "But expect to-morrow,
large party friends." How rejoiced Elizabeth
journey circumstance delayed day!

Her aunt called look picture. She approached saw
likeness Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several miniatures,
mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, liked it.
The housekeeper came forward, told picture young
gentleman, son late master's steward, brought
expense. "He gone army," added;
"but I afraid turned wild."

Mrs. Gardiner looked niece smile, Elizabeth could
return it.

"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing another miniatures,
"is master--and like him. It drawn time
other--about eight years ago."

"I heard much master's fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking picture; "it handsome face. But, Lizzy, tell
us whether like not."

Mrs. Reynolds respect Elizabeth seemed increase
intimation knowing master.

"Does young lady know Mr. Darcy?"

Elizabeth coloured, said: "A little."

"And think handsome gentleman, ma'am?"

"Yes, handsome."

"I sure I know none handsome; gallery stairs
see finer, larger picture this. This room late
master's favourite room, miniatures used
then. He fond them."

This accounted Elizabeth Mr. Wickham's among them.

Mrs. Reynolds directed attention one Miss Darcy, drawn
eight years old.

"And Miss Darcy handsome brother?" said Mrs. Gardiner.

"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady ever seen;
accomplished!--She plays sings day long. In next room
new instrument come her--a present master;
comes to-morrow him."

Mr. Gardiner, whose manners easy pleasant, encouraged
communicativeness questions remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
pride attachment, evidently great pleasure talking
master sister.

"Is master much Pemberley course year?"

"Not much I could wish, sir; I dare say may spend half
time here; Miss Darcy always summer months."

"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when goes Ramsgate."

"If master would marry, might see him."

"Yes, sir; I know _that_ be. I know
good enough him."

Mr. Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could help saying, "It
much credit, I sure, think so."

"I say truth, everybody say knows him,"
replied other. Elizabeth thought going pretty far;
listened increasing astonishment housekeeper added, "I
never known cross word life, I known ever
since four years old."

This praise, others extraordinary, opposite
ideas. That good-tempered man firmest opinion.
Her keenest attention awakened; longed hear more,
grateful uncle saying:

"There people much said. You lucky
master."

"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I go world, I could
meet better. But I always observed,
good-natured children, good-natured grow up;
always sweetest-tempered, generous-hearted boy
world."

Elizabeth almost stared her. "Can Mr. Darcy?" thought she.

"His father excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.

"Yes, ma'am, indeed; son like him--just
affable poor."

Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, impatient more. Mrs.
Reynolds could interest point. She related subjects
pictures, dimensions rooms, price
furniture, vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused kind family
prejudice attributed excessive commendation
master, soon led subject; dwelt energy
many merits proceeded together great staircase.

"He best landlord, best master," said she, "that ever
lived; like wild young men nowadays, think nothing
themselves. There one tenants servants give
good name. Some people call proud; I sure I never saw
anything it. To fancy, rattle away
like young men."

"In amiable light place him!" thought Elizabeth.

"This fine account him," whispered aunt walked, "is
quite consistent behaviour poor friend."

"Perhaps might deceived."

"That likely; authority good."

On reaching spacious lobby shown pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted greater elegance lightness
apartments below; informed done
give pleasure Miss Darcy, taken liking room
last Pemberley.

"He certainly good brother," said Elizabeth, walked towards
one windows.

Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, enter
room. "And always way him," added. "Whatever
give sister pleasure sure done moment. There
nothing would her."

The picture-gallery, two three principal bedrooms,
remained shown. In former many good paintings;
Elizabeth knew nothing art; already
visible below, willingly turned look drawings Miss
Darcy's, crayons, whose subjects usually interesting,
also intelligible.

In gallery many family portraits, could
little fix attention stranger. Elizabeth walked quest
face whose features would known her. At last arrested
her--and beheld striking resemblance Mr. Darcy,
smile face remembered sometimes seen
looked her. She stood several minutes picture, earnest
contemplation, returned quitted gallery.
Mrs. Reynolds informed taken father's
lifetime.

There certainly moment, Elizabeth's mind, gentle
sensation towards original ever felt height
acquaintance. The commendation bestowed Mrs. Reynolds
trifling nature. What praise valuable praise
intelligent servant? As brother, landlord, master,
considered many people's happiness guardianship!--how
much pleasure pain power bestow!--how much
good evil must done him! Every idea brought
forward housekeeper favourable character,
stood canvas represented, fixed
eyes upon herself, thought regard deeper sentiment
gratitude ever raised before; remembered warmth,
softened impropriety expression.

When house open general inspection seen,
returned downstairs, and, taking leave housekeeper,
consigned gardener, met hall-door.

As walked across hall towards river, Elizabeth turned back
look again; uncle aunt stopped also, former
conjecturing date building, owner
suddenly came forward road, led behind stables.

They within twenty yards other, abrupt
appearance, impossible avoid sight. Their eyes
instantly met, cheeks overspread deepest
blush. He absolutely started, moment seemed immovable
surprise; shortly recovering himself, advanced towards party,
spoke Elizabeth, terms perfect composure, least
perfect civility.

She instinctively turned away; stopping approach,
received compliments embarrassment impossible
overcome. Had first appearance, resemblance picture
examining, insufficient assure two
saw Mr. Darcy, gardener's expression surprise,
beholding master, must immediately told it. They stood little
aloof talking niece, who, astonished confused,
scarcely dared lift eyes face, knew answer
returned civil inquiries family. Amazed
alteration manner since last parted, every sentence
uttered increasing embarrassment; every idea
impropriety found recurring mind,
minutes continued uncomfortable
life. Nor seem much ease; spoke, accent
none usual sedateness; repeated inquiries
time left Longbourn, stayed
Derbyshire, often, hurried way, plainly spoke
distraction thoughts.

At length every idea seemed fail him; and, standing
moments without saying word, suddenly recollected himself, took
leave.

The others joined her, expressed admiration figure;
Elizabeth heard word, wholly engrossed feelings,
followed silence. She overpowered shame vexation. Her
coming unfortunate, ill-judged thing
world! How strange must appear him! In disgraceful light
might strike vain man! It might seem purposely
thrown way again! Oh! come? Or,
thus come day expected? Had ten minutes
sooner, beyond reach discrimination;
plain moment arrived--that moment alighted
horse carriage. She blushed
perverseness meeting. And behaviour, strikingly
altered--what could mean? That even speak
amazing!--but speak civility, inquire family!
Never life seen manners little dignified, never
spoken gentleness unexpected meeting. What
contrast offer last address Rosings Park, put
letter hand! She knew think, account
it.

They entered beautiful walk side water,
every step bringing forward nobler fall ground, finer
reach woods approaching; time
Elizabeth sensible it; and, though answered
mechanically repeated appeals uncle aunt,
seemed direct eyes objects pointed out,
distinguished part scene. Her thoughts fixed
one spot Pemberley House, whichever might be, Mr. Darcy
was. She longed know moment passing mind--in
manner thought her, whether, defiance everything,
still dear him. Perhaps civil
felt ease; yet _that_ voice
like ease. Whether felt pain pleasure
seeing could tell, certainly seen
composure.

At length, however, remarks companions absence mind
aroused her, felt necessity appearing like herself.

They entered woods, bidding adieu river while,
ascended higher grounds; when, spots opening
trees gave eye power wander, many charming views
valley, opposite hills, long range woods overspreading
many, occasionally part stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed wish
going round whole park, feared might beyond walk.
With triumphant smile told ten miles round.
It settled matter; pursued accustomed circuit;
brought again, time, descent among hanging woods,
edge water, one narrowest parts. They crossed
simple bridge, character general air scene;
spot less adorned yet visited;
valley, contracted glen, allowed room stream,
narrow walk amidst rough coppice-wood bordered it.
Elizabeth longed explore windings; crossed
bridge, perceived distance house, Mrs. Gardiner,
great walker, could go farther, thought
returning carriage quickly possible. Her niece was,
therefore, obliged submit, took way towards house
opposite side river, nearest direction;
progress slow, Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able indulge
taste, fond fishing, much engaged watching
occasional appearance trout water, talking
man them, advanced little. Whilst wandering
slow manner, surprised, Elizabeth's astonishment
quite equal first, sight Mr. Darcy
approaching them, great distance. The walk
less sheltered side, allowed see
met. Elizabeth, however astonished, least prepared
interview before, resolved appear speak
calmness, really intended meet them. For moments, indeed,
felt would probably strike path. The idea
lasted turning walk concealed view;
turning past, immediately them. With glance, saw
lost none recent civility; and, imitate
politeness, began, met, admire beauty place;
got beyond words "delightful," "charming,"
unlucky recollections obtruded, fancied praise
Pemberley might mischievously construed. Her colour changed,
said more.

Mrs. Gardiner standing little behind; pausing, asked
would honour introducing friends.
This stroke civility quite unprepared;
could hardly suppress smile seeking
acquaintance people pride
revolted offer herself. "What surprise," thought
she, "when knows are? He takes people
fashion."

The introduction, however, immediately made; named
relationship herself, stole sly look him, see bore
it, without expectation decamping fast
could disgraceful companions. That _surprised_
connection evident; sustained it, however, fortitude,
far going away, turned back them, entered
conversation Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could pleased,
could triumph. It consoling know
relations need blush. She listened
attentively passed them, gloried every
expression, every sentence uncle, marked intelligence,
taste, good manners.

The conversation soon turned upon fishing; heard Mr. Darcy
invite him, greatest civility, fish often
chose continued neighbourhood, offering time
supply fishing tackle, pointing parts
stream usually sport. Mrs. Gardiner,
walking arm-in-arm Elizabeth, gave look expressive wonder.
Elizabeth said nothing, gratified exceedingly; compliment
must herself. Her astonishment, however, extreme,
continually repeating, "Why altered? From
proceed? It cannot _me_--it cannot _my_ sake
manners thus softened. My reproofs Hunsford could work
change this. It impossible still love me."

After walking time way, two ladies front, two
gentlemen behind, resuming places, descending
brink river better inspection curious
water-plant, chanced little alteration. It originated
Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued exercise morning, found
Elizabeth's arm inadequate support, consequently preferred
husband's. Mr. Darcy took place niece, walked
together. After short silence, lady first spoke. She wished
know assured absence came
place, accordingly began observing, arrival
unexpected--"for housekeeper," added, "informed us
would certainly till to-morrow; indeed,
left Bakewell, understood immediately expected
country." He acknowledged truth all, said
business steward occasioned coming forward hours
rest party travelling. "They
join early to-morrow," continued, "and among
claim acquaintance you--Mr. Bingley sisters."

Elizabeth answered slight bow. Her thoughts instantly
driven back time Mr. Bingley's name last
mentioned them; and, might judge complexion, _his_
mind differently engaged.

"There also one person party," continued
pause, "who particularly wishes known you. Will allow
me, I ask much, introduce sister acquaintance
stay Lambton?"

The surprise application great indeed; great
know manner acceded it. She immediately felt
whatever desire Miss Darcy might acquainted
must work brother, and, without looking farther,
satisfactory; gratifying know resentment made
think really ill her.

They walked silence, deep thought. Elizabeth
comfortable; impossible; flattered
pleased. His wish introducing sister compliment
highest kind. They soon outstripped others,
reached carriage, Mr. Mrs. Gardiner half quarter
mile behind.

He asked walk house--but declared
tired, stood together lawn. At time much might
said, silence awkward. She wanted talk,
seemed embargo every subject. At last recollected
travelling, talked Matlock Dove Dale
great perseverance. Yet time aunt moved slowly--and
patience ideas nearly worn tete-a-tete
over. On Mr. Mrs. Gardiner's coming pressed go
house take refreshment; declined,
parted side utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed
ladies carriage; drove off, Elizabeth saw
walking slowly towards house.

The observations uncle aunt began;
pronounced infinitely superior anything expected.
"He perfectly well behaved, polite, unassuming," said uncle.

"There _is_ something little stately him, sure," replied
aunt, "but confined air, unbecoming. I
say housekeeper, though people may call proud, I
seen nothing it."

"I never surprised behaviour us. It
civil; really attentive; necessity
attention. His acquaintance Elizabeth trifling."

"To sure, Lizzy," said aunt, "he handsome Wickham;
or, rather, Wickham's countenance, features
perfectly good. But came tell
disagreeable?"

Elizabeth excused well could; said liked
better met Kent before, never
seen pleasant morning.

"But perhaps may little whimsical civilities," replied
uncle. "Your great men often are; therefore I shall take
word, might change mind another day, warn
grounds."

Elizabeth felt entirely misunderstood character,
said nothing.

"From seen him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I really
thought could behaved cruel way
anybody done poor Wickham. He ill-natured look.
On contrary, something pleasing mouth
speaks. And something dignity countenance would
give one unfavourable idea heart. But, sure,
good lady showed us house give flaming character!
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But liberal
master, I suppose, _that_ eye servant comprehends every
virtue."

Elizabeth felt called say something vindication
behaviour Wickham; therefore gave understand,
guarded manner could, heard
relations Kent, actions capable different
construction; character means faulty,
Wickham's amiable, considered Hertfordshire. In
confirmation this, related particulars pecuniary
transactions connected, without actually naming
authority, stating might relied on.

Mrs. Gardiner surprised concerned;
approaching scene former pleasures, every idea gave way
charm recollection; much engaged pointing
husband interesting spots environs think
anything else. Fatigued morning's walk
sooner dined set quest former
acquaintance, evening spent satisfactions
intercourse renewed many years' discontinuance.

The occurrences day full interest leave Elizabeth
much attention new friends; could nothing
think, think wonder, Mr. Darcy's civility, and,
all, wishing acquainted sister.



Chapter 44


Elizabeth settled Mr. Darcy would bring sister visit
day reaching Pemberley; consequently
resolved sight inn whole morning.
But conclusion false; morning
arrival Lambton, visitors came. They walking
place new friends, returning inn
dress dining family, sound
carriage drew window, saw gentleman lady
curricle driving street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing
livery, guessed meant, imparted small degree
surprise relations acquainting honour
expected. Her uncle aunt amazement; embarrassment
manner spoke, joined circumstance itself, many
circumstances preceding day, opened new idea
business. Nothing ever suggested before, felt
way accounting attentions
quarter supposing partiality niece. While
newly-born notions passing heads, perturbation
Elizabeth's feelings every moment increasing. She quite
amazed discomposure; amongst causes disquiet,
dreaded lest partiality brother said much
favour; and, commonly anxious please, naturally
suspected every power pleasing would fail her.

She retreated window, fearful seen; walked
room, endeavouring compose herself, saw looks
inquiring surprise uncle aunt made everything worse.

Miss Darcy brother appeared, formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment Elizabeth see new
acquaintance least much embarrassed herself. Since
Lambton, heard Miss Darcy exceedingly proud;
observation minutes convinced
exceedingly shy. She found difficult obtain even word
beyond monosyllable.

Miss Darcy tall, larger scale Elizabeth; and, though
little sixteen, figure formed, appearance
womanly graceful. She less handsome brother;
sense good humour face, manners perfectly
unassuming gentle. Elizabeth, expected find
acute unembarrassed observer ever Mr. Darcy been, much
relieved discerning different feelings.

They long together Mr. Darcy told Bingley
also coming wait her; barely time express
satisfaction, prepare visitor, Bingley's quick
step heard stairs, moment entered room. All
Elizabeth's anger long done away; still
felt any, could hardly stood ground unaffected
cordiality expressed seeing again. He
inquired friendly, though general way, family, looked
spoke good-humoured ease ever done.

To Mr. Mrs. Gardiner scarcely less interesting personage
herself. They long wished see him. The whole party
them, indeed, excited lively attention. The suspicions
arisen Mr. Darcy niece directed observation towards
earnest though guarded inquiry; soon drew
inquiries full conviction one least knew
love. Of lady's sensations remained little
doubt; gentleman overflowing admiration
evident enough.

Elizabeth, side, much do. She wanted ascertain
feelings visitors; wanted compose own,
make agreeable all; latter object,
feared fail, sure success,
endeavoured give pleasure prepossessed favour. Bingley
ready, Georgiana eager, Darcy determined, pleased.

In seeing Bingley, thoughts naturally flew sister; and, oh!
ardently long know whether directed
like manner. Sometimes could fancy talked less
former occasions, twice pleased notion
that, looked her, trying trace resemblance. But,
though might imaginary, could deceived
behaviour Miss Darcy, set rival Jane. No look
appeared either side spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred
could justify hopes sister. On point
soon satisfied; two three little circumstances occurred
ere parted, which, anxious interpretation, denoted
recollection Jane untinctured tenderness, wish saying
might lead mention her, dared. He observed
her, moment others talking together, tone
something real regret, "was long time since
pleasure seeing her;" and, could reply,
added, "It eight months. We met since 26th
November, dancing together Netherfield."

Elizabeth pleased find memory exact; afterwards
took occasion ask her, unattended rest, whether
_all_ sisters Longbourn. There much question,
preceding remark; look manner
gave meaning.

It often could turn eyes Mr. Darcy himself;
but, whenever catch glimpse, saw expression general
complaisance, said heard accent removed
_hauteur_ disdain companions, convinced
improvement manners yesterday witnessed however
temporary existence might prove, least outlived one day. When
saw thus seeking acquaintance courting good opinion
people intercourse months ago would
disgrace--when saw thus civil, herself,
relations openly disdained, recollected last
lively scene Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, change
great, struck forcibly mind, could hardly
restrain astonishment visible. Never, even company
dear friends Netherfield, dignified relations
Rosings, seen desirous please, free
self-consequence unbending reserve, now, importance
could result success endeavours, even
acquaintance attentions addressed would draw
ridicule censure ladies Netherfield
Rosings.

Their visitors stayed half-an-hour; arose
depart, Mr. Darcy called sister join expressing
wish seeing Mr. Mrs. Gardiner, Miss Bennet, dinner
Pemberley, left country. Miss Darcy, though
diffidence marked little habit giving invitations,
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked niece, desirous knowing
_she_, invitation concerned, felt disposed
acceptance, Elizabeth turned away head. Presuming however,
studied avoidance spoke rather momentary embarrassment
dislike proposal, seeing husband, fond
society, perfect willingness accept it, ventured engage
attendance, day next fixed on.

Bingley expressed great pleasure certainty seeing Elizabeth
again, still great deal say her, many inquiries
make Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing
wish hearing speak sister, pleased,
account, well others, found herself,
visitors left them, capable considering last half-hour
satisfaction, though passing, enjoyment
little. Eager alone, fearful inquiries hints
uncle aunt, stayed long enough hear
favourable opinion Bingley, hurried away dress.

But reason fear Mr. Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity;
wish force communication. It evident
much better acquainted Mr. Darcy idea of;
evident much love her. They saw much
interest, nothing justify inquiry.

Of Mr. Darcy matter anxiety think well; and, far
acquaintance reached, fault find. They could
untouched politeness; drawn character
feelings servant's report, without reference
account, circle Hertfordshire known
would recognized Mr. Darcy. There interest,
however, believing housekeeper; soon became sensible
authority servant known since four
years old, whose manners indicated respectability,
hastily rejected. Neither anything occurred intelligence
Lambton friends could materially lessen weight. They
nothing accuse pride; pride probably had, not,
would certainly imputed inhabitants small market-town
family visit. It acknowledged, however,
liberal man, much good among poor.

With respect Wickham, travellers soon found held
much estimation; though chief concerns
son patron imperfectly understood, yet well-known
fact that, quitting Derbyshire, left many debts behind
him, Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.

As Elizabeth, thoughts Pemberley evening
last; evening, though passed seemed long,
long enough determine feelings towards _one_ mansion;
lay awake two whole hours endeavouring make out. She
certainly hate him. No; hatred vanished long ago,
almost long ashamed ever feeling dislike him,
could called. The respect created conviction
valuable qualities, though first unwillingly admitted,
time ceased repugnant feeling; heightened
somewhat friendlier nature, testimony highly
favour, bringing forward disposition amiable light,
yesterday produced. But all, respect esteem,
motive within goodwill could overlooked.
It gratitude; gratitude, merely loved her,
loving still well enough forgive petulance
acrimony manner rejecting him, unjust accusations
accompanying rejection. He who, persuaded, would avoid
greatest enemy, seemed, accidental meeting,
eager preserve acquaintance, without indelicate display
regard, peculiarity manner, two selves
concerned, soliciting good opinion friends, bent
making known sister. Such change man much
pride exciting astonishment gratitude--for love, ardent
love, must attributed; impression
sort encouraged, means unpleasing, though could
exactly defined. She respected, esteemed, grateful him,
felt real interest welfare; wanted know
far wished welfare depend upon herself, far would
happiness employ power,
fancy told still possessed, bringing renewal
addresses.

It settled evening aunt niece,
striking civility Miss Darcy's coming see
day arrival Pemberley, reached
late breakfast, ought imitated, though could equalled,
exertion politeness side; and, consequently,
would highly expedient wait Pemberley following
morning. They were, therefore, go. Elizabeth pleased; though
asked reason, little say reply.

Mr. Gardiner left soon breakfast. The fishing scheme
renewed day before, positive engagement made meeting
gentlemen Pemberley noon.



Chapter 45


Convinced Elizabeth Miss Bingley's dislike
originated jealousy, could help feeling unwelcome
appearance Pemberley must her, curious know
much civility lady's side acquaintance would renewed.

On reaching house, shown hall saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered delightful summer. Its windows
opening ground, admitted refreshing view high woody
hills behind house, beautiful oaks Spanish chestnuts
scattered intermediate lawn.

In house received Miss Darcy, sitting
Mrs. Hurst Miss Bingley, lady lived
London. Georgiana's reception civil, attended
embarrassment which, though proceeding shyness fear
wrong, would easily give felt inferior
belief proud reserved. Mrs. Gardiner niece,
however, justice, pitied her.

By Mrs. Hurst Miss Bingley noticed curtsey; and,
seated, pause, awkward pauses must always be,
succeeded moments. It first broken Mrs. Annesley,
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour introduce kind
discourse proved truly well-bred either
others; Mrs. Gardiner, occasional help
Elizabeth, conversation carried on. Miss Darcy looked
wished courage enough join it; sometimes venture
short sentence least danger heard.

Elizabeth soon saw closely watched Miss Bingley,
could speak word, especially Miss Darcy, without
calling attention. This observation would prevented
trying talk latter, seated
inconvenient distance; sorry spared necessity
saying much. Her thoughts employing her. She expected every
moment gentlemen would enter room. She wished,
feared master house might amongst them; whether
wished feared most, could scarcely determine. After
sitting manner quarter hour without hearing Miss
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth roused receiving cold
inquiry health family. She answered equal
indifference brevity, said more.

The next variation visit afforded produced
entrance servants cold meat, cake, variety
finest fruits season; take place till many
significant look smile Mrs. Annesley Miss Darcy
given, remind post. There employment whole
party--for though could talk, could eat;
beautiful pyramids grapes, nectarines, peaches soon collected
round table.

While thus engaged, Elizabeth fair opportunity deciding whether
feared wished appearance Mr. Darcy,
feelings prevailed entering room; then, though
moment believed wishes predominate, began
regret came.

He time Mr. Gardiner, who, two three
gentlemen house, engaged river, left
learning ladies family intended visit
Georgiana morning. No sooner appear Elizabeth wisely
resolved perfectly easy unembarrassed; resolution
necessary made, perhaps easily kept,
saw suspicions whole party awakened them,
scarcely eye watch behaviour
first came room. In countenance attentive
curiosity strongly marked Miss Bingley's, spite
smiles overspread face whenever spoke one
objects; jealousy yet made desperate, attentions
Mr. Darcy means over. Miss Darcy, brother's
entrance, exerted much talk, Elizabeth saw
anxious sister get acquainted, forwarded
much possible, every attempt conversation either side. Miss
Bingley saw likewise; and, imprudence anger, took
first opportunity saying, sneering civility:

"Pray, Miss Eliza, ----shire Militia removed Meryton?
They must great loss _your_ family."

In Darcy's presence dared mention Wickham's name; Elizabeth
instantly comprehended uppermost thoughts;
various recollections connected gave moment's distress;
exerting vigorously repel ill-natured attack,
presently answered question tolerably detached tone. While
spoke, involuntary glance showed Darcy, heightened
complexion, earnestly looking her, sister overcome
confusion, unable lift eyes. Had Miss Bingley known
pain giving beloved friend, undoubtedly would
refrained hint; merely intended discompose
Elizabeth bringing forward idea man believed
partial, make betray sensibility might injure
Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, remind latter follies
absurdities part family connected
corps. Not syllable ever reached Miss Darcy's
meditated elopement. To creature revealed, secrecy
possible, except Elizabeth; Bingley's connections
brother particularly anxious conceal it,
wish Elizabeth long ago attributed him, becoming
hereafter own. He certainly formed plan, without
meaning affect endeavour separate Miss
Bennet, probable might add something lively concern
welfare friend.

Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted emotion;
Miss Bingley, vexed disappointed, dared approach nearer
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered time, though enough able
speak more. Her brother, whose eye feared meet, scarcely
recollected interest affair, circumstance
designed turn thoughts Elizabeth seemed
fixed cheerfully.

Their visit continue long question answer
mentioned; Mr. Darcy attending carriage Miss
Bingley venting feelings criticisms Elizabeth's person,
behaviour, dress. But Georgiana would join her. Her brother's
recommendation enough ensure favour; judgement could
err. And spoken terms Elizabeth leave Georgiana
without power finding otherwise lovely amiable. When
Darcy returned saloon, Miss Bingley could help repeating
part saying sister.

"How ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks morning, Mr. Darcy,"
cried; "I never life saw anyone much altered since
winter. She grown brown coarse! Louisa I agreeing
known again."

However little Mr. Darcy might liked address, contented
coolly replying perceived alteration
rather tanned, miraculous consequence travelling
summer.

"For part," rejoined, "I must confess I never could
see beauty her. Her face thin; complexion
brilliancy; features handsome. Her nose
wants character--there nothing marked lines. Her teeth
tolerable, common way; eyes,
sometimes called fine, I could never see anything
extraordinary them. They sharp, shrewish look, I
like all; air altogether self-sufficiency
without fashion, intolerable."

Persuaded Miss Bingley Darcy admired Elizabeth,
best method recommending herself; angry people always
wise; seeing last look somewhat nettled,
success expected. He resolutely silent, however, and,
determination making speak, continued:

"I remember, first knew Hertfordshire, amazed
find reputed beauty; I particularly recollect
saying one night, dining Netherfield, '_She_
beauty!--I soon call mother wit.' But afterwards
seemed improve you, I believe thought rather pretty
one time."

"Yes," replied Darcy, could contain longer, "but _that_
I first saw her, many months since I
considered one handsomest women acquaintance."

He went away, Miss Bingley left satisfaction
forced say gave one pain herself.

Mrs. Gardiner Elizabeth talked occurred
visit, returned, except particularly interested
both. The look behaviour everybody seen discussed,
except person mostly engaged attention. They talked
sister, friends, house, fruit--of everything
himself; yet Elizabeth longing know Mrs. Gardiner thought
him, Mrs. Gardiner would highly gratified niece's
beginning subject.



Chapter 46


Elizabeth good deal disappointed finding letter
Jane first arrival Lambton; disappointment
renewed mornings spent there;
third repining over, sister justified,
receipt two letters once, one marked
missent elsewhere. Elizabeth surprised it,
Jane written direction remarkably ill.

They preparing walk letters came in;
uncle aunt, leaving enjoy quiet, set
themselves. The one missent must first attended to;
written five days ago. The beginning contained account
little parties engagements, news country afforded;
latter half, dated day later, written evident
agitation, gave important intelligence. It effect:

"Since writing above, dearest Lizzy, something occurred
unexpected serious nature; I afraid alarming you--be
assured well. What I say relates poor Lydia.
An express came twelve last night, gone bed,
Colonel Forster, inform us gone Scotland
one officers; truth, Wickham! Imagine
surprise. To Kitty, however, seem wholly unexpected. I
very, sorry. So imprudent match sides! But I willing
hope best, character misunderstood.
Thoughtless indiscreet I easily believe him, step
(and let us rejoice it) marks nothing bad heart. His choice
disinterested least, must know father give nothing.
Our poor mother sadly grieved. My father bears better. How
thankful I never let know said
him; must forget ourselves. They Saturday night
twelve, conjectured, missed till yesterday morning
eight. The express sent directly. My dear Lizzy, must
passed within ten miles us. Colonel Forster gives us reason expect
soon. Lydia left lines wife, informing
intention. I must conclude, I cannot long poor
mother. I afraid able make out, I hardly
know I written."

Without allowing time consideration, scarcely knowing
felt, Elizabeth finishing letter instantly seized
other, opening utmost impatience, read follows:
written day later conclusion first.

"By time, dearest sister, received hurried letter; I
wish may intelligible, though confined time,
head bewildered I cannot answer coherent. Dearest
Lizzy, I hardly know I would write, I bad news you,
cannot delayed. Imprudent marriage Mr. Wickham
poor Lydia would be, anxious assured
taken place, much reason fear gone
Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, left Brighton
day before, many hours express. Though Lydia's short
letter Mrs. F. gave understand going Gretna
Green, something dropped Denny expressing belief W.
never intended go there, marry Lydia all,
repeated Colonel F., who, instantly taking alarm, set B.
intending trace route. He trace easily Clapham,
further; entering place, removed hackney
coach, dismissed chaise brought Epsom. All
known is, seen continue London road.
I know think. After making every possible inquiry
side London, Colonel F. came Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
turnpikes, inns Barnet Hatfield,
without success--no people seen pass through. With
kindest concern came Longbourn, broke apprehensions
us manner creditable heart. I sincerely grieved
Mrs. F., one throw blame them. Our
distress, dear Lizzy, great. My father mother believe
worst, I cannot think ill him. Many circumstances might make
eligible married privately town pursue
first plan; even _he_ could form design
young woman Lydia's connections, likely, I suppose
lost everything? Impossible! I grieve find, however,
Colonel F. disposed depend upon marriage; shook
head I expressed hopes, said feared W. man
trusted. My poor mother really ill, keeps room. Could
exert herself, would better; expected. And
father, I never life saw affected. Poor Kitty
anger concealed attachment; matter
confidence, one cannot wonder. I truly glad, dearest Lizzy,
spared something distressing scenes; now,
first shock over, shall I I long return? I
selfish, however, press it, inconvenient. Adieu! I
take pen I told I would not;
circumstances I cannot help earnestly begging
come soon possible. I know dear uncle aunt well,
I afraid requesting it, though I still something
ask former. My father going London Colonel
Forster instantly, try discover her. What means I sure
I know not; excessive distress allow pursue
measure best safest way, Colonel Forster obliged
Brighton to-morrow evening. In exigence,
uncle's advice assistance would everything world;
immediately comprehend I must feel, I rely upon goodness."

"Oh! where, uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting seat
finished letter, eagerness follow him, without losing
moment time precious; reached door
opened servant, Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face impetuous
manner made start, could recover speak,
she, whose mind every idea superseded Lydia's situation,
hastily exclaimed, "I beg pardon, I must leave you. I must find
Mr. Gardiner moment, business cannot delayed; I
instant lose."

"Good God! matter?" cried he, feeling
politeness; recollecting himself, "I detain minute;
let me, let servant go Mr. Mrs. Gardiner. You
well enough; cannot go yourself."

Elizabeth hesitated, knees trembled felt
little would gained attempting pursue them. Calling back
servant, therefore, commissioned him, though breathless
accent made almost unintelligible, fetch master
mistress home instantly.

On quitting room sat down, unable support herself,
looking miserably ill, impossible Darcy leave her,
refrain saying, tone gentleness commiseration,
"Let call maid. Is nothing could take give
present relief? A glass wine; shall I get one? You ill."

"No, I thank you," replied, endeavouring recover herself. "There
nothing matter me. I quite well; I distressed
dreadful news I received Longbourn."

She burst tears alluded it, minutes could
speak another word. Darcy, wretched suspense, could say
something indistinctly concern, observe compassionate
silence. At length spoke again. "I letter Jane,
dreadful news. It cannot concealed anyone. My younger
sister left friends--has eloped; thrown
power of--of Mr. Wickham. They gone together Brighton.
_You_ know well doubt rest. She money,
connections, nothing tempt to--she lost ever."

Darcy fixed astonishment. "When I consider," added yet
agitated voice, "that I might prevented it! I, knew
was. Had I explained part only--some part I
learnt, family! Had character known, could
happened. But all--all late now."

"I grieved indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked. But
certain--absolutely certain?"

"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together Sunday night, traced
almost London, beyond; certainly gone
Scotland."

"And done, attempted, recover her?"

"My father gone London, Jane written beg uncle's
immediate assistance; shall off, I hope, half-an-hour. But
nothing done--I know well nothing done. How
man worked on? How even discovered? I
smallest hope. It every way horrible!"

Darcy shook head silent acquiescence.

"When _my_ eyes opened real character--Oh! I known
I ought, I dared do! But I knew not--I afraid
much. Wretched, wretched mistake!"

Darcy made answer. He seemed scarcely hear her, walking
room earnest meditation, brow contracted, air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, instantly understood it. Her
power sinking; everything _must_ sink proof family
weakness, assurance deepest disgrace. She could neither
wonder condemn, belief self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory bosom, afforded palliation distress. It
was, contrary, exactly calculated make understand
wishes; never honestly felt could loved
him, now, love must vain.

But self, though would intrude, could engross her. Lydia--the
humiliation, misery bringing all, soon swallowed
every private care; covering face handkerchief,
Elizabeth soon lost everything else; and, pause
several minutes, recalled sense situation
voice companion, who, manner which, though spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I afraid
long desiring absence, I anything plead excuse
stay, real, though unavailing concern. Would Heaven anything
could either said done part might offer consolation
distress! But I torment vain wishes, may
seem purposely ask thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I
fear, prevent sister's pleasure seeing Pemberley
to-day."

"Oh, yes. Be kind apologise us Miss Darcy. Say
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal unhappy truth
long possible, I know cannot long."

He readily assured secrecy; expressed sorrow
distress, wished happier conclusion present
reason hope, leaving compliments relations,
one serious, parting look, went away.

As quitted room, Elizabeth felt improbable
ever see terms cordiality
marked several meetings Derbyshire; threw
retrospective glance whole acquaintance, full
contradictions varieties, sighed perverseness
feelings would promoted continuance, would
formerly rejoiced termination.

If gratitude esteem good foundations affection, Elizabeth's
change sentiment neither improbable faulty. But
otherwise--if regard springing sources unreasonable
unnatural, comparison often described arising
first interview object, even two words
exchanged, nothing said defence, except given
somewhat trial latter method partiality Wickham,
ill success might, perhaps, authorise seek
less interesting mode attachment. Be may, saw
go regret; early example Lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish reflected wretched
business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, entertained
hope Wickham's meaning marry her. No one Jane, thought,
could flatter expectation. Surprise least
feelings development. While contents first
letter remained mind, surprise--all astonishment
Wickham marry girl impossible could marry
money; Lydia could ever attached appeared
incomprehensible. But natural. For attachment
might sufficient charms; though suppose
Lydia deliberately engaging elopement without intention
marriage, difficulty believing neither virtue
understanding would preserve falling easy prey.

She never perceived, regiment Hertfordshire,
Lydia partiality him; convinced Lydia
wanted encouragement attach anybody. Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another, favourite, attentions
raised opinion. Her affections continually
fluctuating never without object. The mischief neglect
mistaken indulgence towards girl--oh! acutely
feel it!

She wild home--to hear, see, upon spot
share Jane cares must fall wholly upon her,
family deranged, father absent, mother incapable exertion,
requiring constant attendance; though almost persuaded nothing
could done Lydia, uncle's interference seemed utmost
importance, till entered room impatience severe. Mr.
Mrs. Gardiner hurried back alarm, supposing servant's
account niece taken suddenly ill; satisfying
instantly head, eagerly communicated cause
summons, reading two letters aloud, dwelling postscript
last trembling energy, though Lydia never
favourite them, Mr. Mrs. Gardiner could deeply
afflicted. Not Lydia only, concerned it;
first exclamations surprise horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every
assistance power. Elizabeth, though expecting less, thanked
tears gratitude; three actuated one spirit,
everything relating journey speedily settled. They
soon possible. "But done Pemberley?"
cried Mrs. Gardiner. "John told us Mr. Darcy sent
us; so?"

"Yes; I told able keep engagement.
_That_ settled."

"What settled?" repeated other, ran room
prepare. "And upon terms disclose real
truth? Oh, I knew was!"

But wishes vain, least could serve amuse
hurry confusion following hour. Had Elizabeth leisure
idle, would remained certain employment
impossible one wretched herself; share
business well aunt, amongst rest notes
written friends Lambton, false excuses
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw whole completed; Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile settled account inn, nothing
remained done go; Elizabeth, misery
morning, found herself, shorter space time could
supposed, seated carriage, road Longbourn.



Chapter 47


"I thinking again, Elizabeth," said uncle,
drove town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I much
inclined I judge eldest sister
matter. It appears unlikely young man
form design girl means unprotected
friendless, actually staying colonel's family, I
strongly inclined hope best. Could expect friends
would step forward? Could expect noticed
regiment, affront Colonel Forster? His temptation
adequate risk!"

"Do really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening moment.

"Upon word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin uncle's
opinion. It really great violation decency, honour,
interest, guilty of. I cannot think ill
Wickham. Can yourself, Lizzy, wholly give up, believe
capable it?"

"Not, perhaps, neglecting interest; every
neglect I believe capable. If, indeed, so! But I
dare hope it. Why go Scotland
case?"

"In first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there absolute proof
gone Scotland."

"Oh! removing chaise hackney coach
presumption! And, besides, traces found
Barnet road."

"Well, then--supposing London. They may there, though
purpose concealment, exceptional purpose. It
likely money abundant either side;
might strike could economically, though less
expeditiously, married London Scotland."

"But secrecy? Why fear detection? Why must
marriage private? Oh, no, no--this likely. His particular
friend, see Jane's account, persuaded never intending
marry her. Wickham never marry woman without money. He
cannot afford it. And claims Lydia--what attraction
beyond youth, health, good humour could make him, sake,
forego every chance benefiting marrying well? As
restraint apprehensions disgrace corps might throw
dishonourable elopement her, I able judge; I know
nothing effects step might produce. But
objection, I afraid hardly hold good. Lydia
brothers step forward; might imagine, father's
behaviour, indolence little attention ever
seemed give going forward family, _he_ would
little, think little it, father could do,
matter."

"But think Lydia lost everything love
consent live terms marriage?"

"It seem, shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth,
tears eyes, "that sister's sense decency virtue
point admit doubt. But, really, I know say.
Perhaps I justice. But young; never
taught think serious subjects; last half-year,
nay, twelvemonth--she given nothing amusement
vanity. She allowed dispose time idle
frivolous manner, adopt opinions came way.
Since ----shire first quartered Meryton, nothing love,
flirtation, officers head. She
everything power thinking talking subject, give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility feelings;
naturally lively enough. And know Wickham every charm
person address captivate woman."

"But see Jane," said aunt, "does think ill
Wickham believe capable attempt."

"Of Jane ever think ill? And there, whatever might
former conduct, would think capable attempt,
till proved them? But Jane knows, well I do,
Wickham really is. We know profligate every
sense word; neither integrity honour;
false deceitful insinuating."

"And really know this?" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
mode intelligence alive.

"I indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. "I told you, day,
infamous behaviour Mr. Darcy; yourself, last
Longbourn, heard manner spoke man behaved
forbearance liberality towards him. And
circumstances I liberty--which worth
relate; lies whole Pemberley family endless. From
said Miss Darcy I thoroughly prepared see proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet knew contrary himself. He
must know amiable unpretending found
her."

"But Lydia know nothing this? ignorant
Jane seem well understand?"

"Oh, yes!--that, worst all. Till I Kent, saw
much Mr. Darcy relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I
ignorant truth myself. And I returned home, ----shire
leave Meryton week fortnight's time. As
case, neither Jane, I related whole, I, thought
necessary make knowledge public; use could
apparently one, good opinion
neighbourhood overthrown? And even
settled Lydia go Mrs. Forster, necessity opening
eyes character never occurred me. That _she_ could
danger deception never entered head. That
consequence _this_ could ensue, may easily believe, far
enough thoughts."

"When removed Brighton, therefore, reason, I
suppose, believe fond other?"

"Not slightest. I remember symptom affection either
side; anything kind perceptible, must aware
family could thrown away. When first
entered corps, ready enough admire him;
were. Every girl near Meryton senses
first two months; never distinguished _her_ particular
attention; and, consequently, moderate period extravagant
wild admiration, fancy gave way, others regiment,
treated distinction, became favourites."

It may easily believed, however little novelty could added
fears, hopes, conjectures, interesting subject,
repeated discussion, could detain long,
whole journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts never absent.
Fixed keenest anguish, self-reproach, could find
interval ease forgetfulness.

They travelled expeditiously possible, and, sleeping one night
road, reached Longbourn dinner time next day. It
comfort Elizabeth consider Jane could wearied
long expectations.

The little Gardiners, attracted sight chaise, standing
steps house entered paddock; and,
carriage drove door, joyful surprise lighted
faces, displayed whole bodies, variety
capers frisks, first pleasing earnest welcome.

Elizabeth jumped out; and, giving hasty kiss,
hurried vestibule, Jane, came running
mother's apartment, immediately met her.

Elizabeth, affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled
eyes both, lost moment asking whether anything
heard fugitives.

"Not yet," replied Jane. "But dear uncle come, I hope
everything well."

"Is father town?"

"Yes, went Tuesday, I wrote word."

"And heard often?"

"We heard twice. He wrote lines Wednesday say
arrived safety, give directions, I
particularly begged do. He merely added write
till something importance mention."

"And mother--how she? How all?"

"My mother tolerably well, I trust; though spirits greatly
shaken. She stairs great satisfaction seeing
all. She yet leave dressing-room. Mary Kitty, thank
Heaven, quite well."

"But you--how you?" cried Elizabeth. "You look pale. How much
must gone through!"

Her sister, however, assured perfectly well;
conversation, passing Mr. Mrs. Gardiner
engaged children, put end approach
whole party. Jane ran uncle aunt, welcomed
thanked both, alternate smiles tears.

When drawing-room, questions Elizabeth
already asked course repeated others, soon
found Jane intelligence give. The sanguine hope
good, however, benevolence heart suggested yet
deserted her; still expected would end well,
every morning would bring letter, either Lydia father,
explain proceedings, and, perhaps, announce marriage.

Mrs. Bennet, whose apartment repaired, minutes'
conversation together, received exactly might expected;
tears lamentations regret, invectives villainous
conduct Wickham, complaints sufferings ill-usage;
blaming everybody person whose ill-judging indulgence
errors daughter must principally owing.

"If I able," said she, "to carry point going Brighton,
family, _this_ would happened; poor dear Lydia
nobody take care her. Why Forsters ever let go
sight? I sure great neglect
side, kind girl thing
well looked after. I always thought unfit
charge her; I overruled, I always am. Poor dear child!
And here's Mr. Bennet gone away, I know fight Wickham,
wherever meets killed, become
us all? The Collinses turn us cold
grave, kind us, brother, I know
shall do."

They exclaimed terrific ideas; Mr. Gardiner,
general assurances affection family, told
meant London next day, would assist Mr.
Bennet every endeavour recovering Lydia.

"Do give way useless alarm," added he; "though right
prepared worst, occasion look certain.
It quite week since left Brighton. In days
may gain news them; till know married,
design marrying, let us give matter
lost. As soon I get town I shall go brother, make
come home Gracechurch Street; may consult
together done."

"Oh! dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that exactly I
could wish for. And do, get town, find out,
wherever may be; married already, _make_
marry. And wedding clothes, let wait that,
tell Lydia shall much money chooses buy them,
married. And, all, keep Mr. Bennet fighting.
Tell dreadful state I in, I frighted
wits--and tremblings, flutterings, me--such
spasms side pains head, beatings heart,
I get rest night day. And tell dear Lydia
give directions clothes till seen me,
know best warehouses. Oh, brother, kind are! I
know contrive all."

But Mr. Gardiner, though assured earnest endeavours
cause, could avoid recommending moderation her, well
hopes fear; talking manner till
dinner table, left vent feelings
housekeeper, attended absence daughters.

Though brother sister persuaded real
occasion seclusion family, attempt
oppose it, knew prudence enough hold
tongue servants, waited table, judged
better _one_ household, one could
trust comprehend fears solicitude
subject.

In dining-room soon joined Mary Kitty,
busily engaged separate apartments make appearance
before. One came books, toilette. The
faces both, however, tolerably calm; change visible
either, except loss favourite sister, anger
incurred business, given
fretfulness usual accents Kitty. As Mary,
mistress enough whisper Elizabeth, countenance
grave reflection, soon seated table:

"This unfortunate affair, probably much talked of.
But must stem tide malice, pour wounded bosoms
balm sisterly consolation."

Then, perceiving Elizabeth inclination replying, added,
"Unhappy event must Lydia, may draw useful
lesson: loss virtue female irretrievable; one
false step involves endless ruin; reputation less
brittle beautiful; cannot much guarded
behaviour towards undeserving sex."

Elizabeth lifted eyes amazement, much oppressed
make reply. Mary, however, continued console
kind moral extractions evil them.

In afternoon, two elder Miss Bennets able
half-an-hour themselves; Elizabeth instantly availed
opportunity making inquiries, Jane equally eager
satisfy. After joining general lamentations dreadful sequel
event, Elizabeth considered certain, Miss
Bennet could assert wholly impossible, former continued
subject, saying, "But tell everything
I already heard. Give particulars. What Colonel
Forster say? Had apprehension anything elopement
took place? They must seen together ever."

"Colonel Forster often suspected partiality,
especially Lydia's side, nothing give alarm. I
grieved him! His behaviour attentive kind utmost. He
_was_ coming us, order assure us concern,
idea gone Scotland: apprehension
first got abroad, hastened journey."

"And Denny convinced Wickham would marry? Did know
intending go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"

"Yes; but, questioned _him_, Denny denied knowing anything
plans, would give real opinion it. He
repeat persuasion marrying--and _that_, I
inclined hope, might misunderstood before."

"And till Colonel Forster came himself, one entertained
doubt, I suppose, really married?"

"How possible idea enter brains? I felt
little uneasy--a little fearful sister's happiness
marriage, I knew conduct always quite
right. My father mother knew nothing that; felt
imprudent match must be. Kitty owned, natural
triumph knowing rest us, Lydia's last letter
prepared step. She known, seems,
love other, many weeks."

"But went Brighton?"

"No, I believe not."

"And Colonel Forster appear think well Wickham himself? Does
know real character?"

"I must confess speak well Wickham formerly
did. He believed imprudent extravagant. And since sad
affair taken place, said left Meryton greatly debt;
I hope may false."

"Oh, Jane, less secret, told knew him,
could happened!"

"Perhaps would better," replied sister. "But expose
former faults person without knowing present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted best intentions."

"Could Colonel Forster repeat particulars Lydia's note
wife?"

"He brought us see."

Jane took pocket-book, gave Elizabeth. These
contents:

"MY DEAR HARRIET,

"You laugh know I gone, I cannot help
laughing surprise to-morrow morning, soon I
missed. I going Gretna Green, cannot guess who,
I shall think simpleton, one man world I
love, angel. I never happy without him, think
harm off. You need send word Longbourn
going, like it, make surprise greater,
I write sign name 'Lydia Wickham.' What good joke
be! I hardly write laughing. Pray make excuses
Pratt keeping engagement, dancing to-night.
Tell I hope excuse knows all; tell I
dance next ball meet, great pleasure. I shall
send clothes I get Longbourn; I wish would tell
Sally mend great slit worked muslin gown
packed up. Good-bye. Give love Colonel Forster. I hope
drink good journey.

"Your affectionate friend,

"LYDIA BENNET."

"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth
finished it. "What letter this, written moment!
But least shows _she_ serious subject
journey. Whatever might afterwards persuade to,
side _scheme_ infamy. My poor father! must felt it!"

"I never saw anyone shocked. He could speak word full ten
minutes. My mother taken ill immediately, whole house
confusion!"

"Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was servant belonging
know whole story end day?"

"I know. I hope was. But guarded time
difficult. My mother hysterics, though I endeavoured
give every assistance power, I afraid I
much I might done! But horror might possibly happen
almost took faculties."

"Your attendance upon much you. You look
well. Oh I you! every care anxiety
upon alone."

"Mary Kitty kind, would shared every
fatigue, I sure; I think right either them.
Kitty slight delicate; Mary studies much, hours
repose broken on. My aunt Phillips came Longbourn
Tuesday, father went away; good stay till
Thursday me. She great use comfort us all. And
Lady Lucas kind; walked Wednesday morning
condole us, offered services, daughters',
use us."

"She better stayed home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps
_meant_ well, but, misfortune this, one cannot see
little one's neighbours. Assistance impossible; condolence
insufferable. Let triumph us distance, satisfied."

She proceeded inquire measures father
intended pursue, town, recovery daughter.

"He meant I believe," replied Jane, "to go Epsom, place
last changed horses, see postilions try anything could
made them. His principal object must discover
number hackney coach took Clapham. It come
fare London; thought circumstance
gentleman lady's removing one carriage another might

discover house coachman set fare,
determined make inquiries there, hoped might impossible

designs formed; hurry gone,
spirits greatly discomposed, I difficulty finding
even much this."



Chapter 48


The whole party hopes letter Mr. Bennet next
morning, post came without bringing single line him.
His family knew be, common occasions, negligent
dilatory correspondent; time hoped exertion.
They forced conclude pleasing intelligence
send; even _that_ would glad certain. Mr.
Gardiner waited letters set off.

When gone, certain least receiving constant
information going on, uncle promised, parting,
prevail Mr. Bennet return Longbourn, soon could,
great consolation sister, considered
security husband's killed duel.

Mrs. Gardiner children remain Hertfordshire
days longer, former thought presence might serviceable
nieces. She shared attendance Mrs. Bennet,
great comfort hours freedom. Their aunt also
visited frequently, always, said, design
cheering heartening up--though, never came without
reporting fresh instance Wickham's extravagance irregularity,
seldom went away without leaving dispirited found
them.

All Meryton seemed striving blacken man who, three months
before, almost angel light. He declared debt
every tradesman place, intrigues, honoured
title seduction, extended every tradesman's family.
Everybody declared wickedest young man world;
everybody began find always distrusted
appearance goodness. Elizabeth, though credit
half said, believed enough make former assurance
sister's ruin certain; even Jane, believed still less
it, became almost hopeless, especially time come
when, gone Scotland, never entirely
despaired of, must probability gained news
them.

Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn Sunday; Tuesday wife received
letter him; told that, arrival, immediately
found brother, persuaded come Gracechurch Street;
Mr. Bennet Epsom Clapham, arrival,
without gaining satisfactory information;
determined inquire principal hotels town, Mr. Bennet
thought possible might gone one them, first
coming London, procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner
expect success measure, brother
eager it, meant assist pursuing it. He added Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined present leave London promised
write soon. There also postscript effect:

"I written Colonel Forster desire find out,
possible, young man's intimates regiment,
whether Wickham relations connections would likely
know part town concealed himself. If
anyone one could apply probability gaining
clue that, might essential consequence. At present
nothing guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, everything
power satisfy us head. But, second thoughts, perhaps,
Lizzy could tell us relations living, better
person."

Elizabeth loss understand whence deference
authority proceeded; power give information
satisfactory nature compliment deserved. She never
heard relations, except father mother,
dead many years. It possible, however,
companions ----shire might able give information;
though sanguine expecting it, application
something look forward to.

Every day Longbourn day anxiety; anxious
part post expected. The arrival letters
grand object every morning's impatience. Through letters,
whatever good bad told would communicated, every
succeeding day expected bring news importance.

But heard Mr. Gardiner, letter arrived
father, different quarter, Mr. Collins; which, Jane
received directions open came absence,
accordingly read; Elizabeth, knew curiosities
letters always were, looked her, read likewise. It
follows:

"MY DEAR SIR,

"I feel called upon, relationship, situation
life, condole grievous affliction
suffering under, yesterday informed letter
Hertfordshire. Be assured, dear sir, Mrs. Collins
sincerely sympathise respectable family,
present distress, must bitterest kind,
proceeding cause time remove. No arguments shall
wanting part alleviate severe misfortune--or
may comfort you, circumstance must others
afflicting parent's mind. The death daughter would
blessing comparison this. And
lamented, reason suppose dear Charlotte
informs me, licentiousness behaviour daughter
proceeded faulty degree indulgence; though, time,
consolation Mrs. Bennet, I inclined think
disposition must naturally bad, could
guilty enormity, early age. Howsoever may be,
grievously pitied; opinion I joined
Mrs. Collins, likewise Lady Catherine daughter,
I related affair. They agree apprehending
false step one daughter injurious fortunes
others; who, Lady Catherine condescendingly says,
connect family? And consideration leads
moreover reflect, augmented satisfaction, certain event
last November; otherwise, I must involved
sorrow disgrace. Let advise you, dear sir,
console much possible, throw unworthy child
affection ever, leave reap fruits
heinous offense.

"I am, dear sir, etc., etc."

Mr. Gardiner write till received answer
Colonel Forster; nothing pleasant nature send.
It known Wickham single relationship
kept connection, certain near one
living. His former acquaintances numerous; since
militia, appear terms
particular friendship them. There one, therefore,
could pointed likely give news him. And
wretched state finances, powerful motive
secrecy, addition fear discovery Lydia's relations,
transpired left gaming debts behind
considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed
thousand pounds would necessary clear expenses Brighton.
He owed good deal town, debts honour still
formidable. Mr. Gardiner attempt conceal particulars
Longbourn family. Jane heard horror. "A gamester!"
cried. "This wholly unexpected. I idea it."

Mr. Gardiner added letter, might expect see
father home following day, Saturday. Rendered
spiritless ill-success endeavours, yielded
brother-in-law's entreaty would return family,
leave whatever occasion might suggest advisable
continuing pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet told this,
express much satisfaction children expected, considering
anxiety life before.

"What, coming home, without poor Lydia?" cried. "Sure
leave London found them. Who fight Wickham,
make marry her, comes away?"

As Mrs. Gardiner began wish home, settled
children go London, time Mr. Bennet
came it. The coach, therefore, took first stage
journey, brought master back Longbourn.

Mrs. Gardiner went away perplexity Elizabeth
Derbyshire friend attended part world. His
name never voluntarily mentioned niece;
kind half-expectation Mrs. Gardiner formed,
followed letter him, ended nothing. Elizabeth
received none since return could come Pemberley.

The present unhappy state family rendered excuse
lowness spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could
fairly conjectured _that_, though Elizabeth, time
tolerably well acquainted feelings, perfectly aware
that, known nothing Darcy, could borne dread
Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would spared her, thought,
one sleepless night two.

When Mr. Bennet arrived, appearance usual
philosophic composure. He said little ever
habit saying; made mention business taken
away, time daughters courage speak
it.

It till afternoon, joined tea,
Elizabeth ventured introduce subject; then, briefly
expressing sorrow must endured, replied, "Say
nothing that. Who suffer myself? It doing,
I ought feel it."

"You must severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.

"You may well warn evil. Human nature prone
fall it! No, Lizzy, let life feel much I
blame. I afraid overpowered impression.
It pass away soon enough."

"Do suppose London?"

"Yes; else well concealed?"

"And Lydia used want go London," added Kitty.

"She happy then," said father drily; "and residence
probably duration."

Then short silence continued:

"Lizzy, I bear ill-will justified advice
last May, which, considering event, shows greatness mind."

They interrupted Miss Bennet, came fetch mother's
tea.

"This parade," cried, "which one good; gives
elegance misfortune! Another day I same; I sit
library, nightcap powdering gown, give much trouble
I can; or, perhaps, I may defer till Kitty runs away."

"I going run away, papa," said Kitty fretfully. "If I
ever go Brighton, I would behave better Lydia."

"_You_ go Brighton. I would trust near Eastbourne
fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I last learnt cautious,
feel effects it. No officer ever enter
house again, even pass village. Balls
absolutely prohibited, unless stand one sisters.
And never stir doors till prove
spent ten minutes every day rational manner."

Kitty, took threats serious light, began cry.

"Well, well," said he, "do make unhappy. If good
girl next ten years, I take review end
them."



Chapter 49


Two days Mr. Bennet's return, Jane Elizabeth walking
together shrubbery behind house, saw housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding came call
mother, went forward meet her; but, instead expected summons,
approached her, said Miss Bennet, "I beg pardon,
madam, interrupting you, I hopes might got
good news town, I took liberty coming ask."

"What mean, Hill? We heard nothing town."

"Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill, great astonishment, "don't know
express come master Mr. Gardiner? He
half-hour, master letter."

Away ran girls, eager get time speech. They
ran vestibule breakfast-room; thence
library; father neither; point
seeking stairs mother, met
butler, said:

"If looking master, ma'am, walking towards
little copse."

Upon information, instantly passed hall
more, ran across lawn father, deliberately
pursuing way towards small wood one side paddock.

Jane, light much habit running
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, sister, panting breath,
came him, eagerly cried out:

"Oh, papa, news--what news? Have heard uncle?"

"Yes I letter express."

"Well, news bring--good bad?"

"What good expected?" said he, taking letter
pocket. "But perhaps would like read it."

Elizabeth impatiently caught hand. Jane came up.

"Read aloud," said father, "for I hardly know
about."

"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.

"MY DEAR BROTHER,

"At last I able send tidings niece, as,
upon whole, I hope give satisfaction. Soon
left Saturday, I fortunate enough find part
London were. The particulars I reserve till meet; enough
know discovered. I seen both--"

"Then I always hoped," cried Jane; "they married!"

Elizabeth read on:

"I seen both. They married, I find
intention so; willing perform
engagements I ventured make side, I hope
long are. All required is, assure
daughter, settlement, equal share five thousand
pounds secured among children decease
sister; and, moreover, enter engagement allowing her,
life, one hundred pounds per annum. These conditions
which, considering everything, I hesitation complying with,
far I thought privileged, you. I shall send
express, time may lost bringing answer. You
easily comprehend, particulars, Mr. Wickham's
circumstances hopeless generally believed be.
The world deceived respect; I happy say
little money, even debts discharged,
settle niece, addition fortune. If, I conclude
case, send full powers act name throughout
whole business, I immediately give directions
Haggerston preparing proper settlement. There
smallest occasion coming town again; therefore stay quiet
Longbourn, depend diligence care. Send back answer
fast can, careful write explicitly. We judged
best niece married house, I hope
approve. She comes us to-day. I shall write soon
anything determined on. Yours, etc.,

"EDW. GARDINER."

"Is possible?" cried Elizabeth, finished. "Can
possible marry her?"

"Wickham undeserving, then, thought him," said
sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you."

"And answered letter?" cried Elizabeth.

"No; must done soon."

Most earnestly entreaty lose time
wrote.

"Oh! dear father," cried, "come back write immediately.
Consider important every moment case."

"Let write you," said Jane, "if dislike trouble
yourself."

"I dislike much," replied; "but must done."

And saying, turned back them, walked towards house.

"And may I ask--" said Elizabeth; "but terms, I suppose, must
complied with."

"Complied with! I ashamed asking little."

"And _must_ marry! Yet _such_ man!"

"Yes, yes, must marry. There nothing else done. But
two things I want much know; one is, much money
uncle laid bring about; other, I ever
pay him."

"Money! My uncle!" cried Jane, "what mean, sir?"

"I mean, man senses would marry Lydia slight
temptation one hundred year life, fifty I
gone."

"That true," said Elizabeth; "though occurred
before. His debts discharged, something still remain! Oh!
must uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I afraid
distressed himself. A small sum could this."

"No," said father; "Wickham's fool takes farthing
less ten thousand pounds. I sorry think ill him,
beginning relationship."

"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How half sum
repaid?"

Mr. Bennet made answer, them, deep thought, continued
silent till reached house. Their father went
library write, girls walked breakfast-room.

"And really married!" cried Elizabeth, soon
themselves. "How strange is! And _this_
thankful. That marry, small chance happiness,
wretched character, forced rejoice. Oh, Lydia!"

"I comfort thinking," replied Jane, "that certainly would
marry Lydia real regard her. Though kind
uncle done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe ten
thousand pounds, anything like it, advanced. He children
own, may more. How could spare half ten thousand
pounds?"

"If ever able learn Wickham's debts been," said
Elizabeth, "and much settled side sister, shall
exactly know Mr. Gardiner done them, Wickham
sixpence own. The kindness uncle aunt never
requited. Their taking home, affording personal
protection countenance, sacrifice advantage
years gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By time
actually them! If goodness make miserable now,
never deserve happy! What meeting her,
first sees aunt!"

"We must endeavour forget passed either side," said
Jane: "I hope trust yet happy. His consenting
marry proof, I believe, come right way
thinking. Their mutual affection steady them; I flatter
settle quietly, live rational manner, may
time make past imprudence forgotten."

"Their conduct such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you,
I, anybody ever forget. It useless talk it."

It occurred girls mother likelihood
perfectly ignorant happened. They went library,
therefore, asked father whether would wish make
known her. He writing and, without raising head, coolly
replied:

"Just please."

"May take uncle's letter read her?"

"Take whatever like, get away."

Elizabeth took letter writing-table, went stairs
together. Mary Kitty Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, therefore, all. After slight preparation good news,
letter read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
soon Jane read Mr. Gardiner's hope Lydia's soon
married, joy burst forth, every following sentence added
exuberance. She irritation violent delight,
ever fidgety alarm vexation. To know daughter
would married enough. She disturbed fear
felicity, humbled remembrance misconduct.

"My dear, dear Lydia!" cried. "This delightful indeed! She
married! I shall see again! She married sixteen!
My good, kind brother! I knew would be. I knew would manage
everything! How I long see her! see dear Wickham too! But
clothes, wedding clothes! I write sister Gardiner
directly. Lizzy, dear, run father, ask
much give her. Stay, stay, I go myself. Ring bell,
Kitty, Hill. I put things moment. My dear, dear
Lydia! How merry shall together meet!"

Her eldest daughter endeavoured give relief violence
transports, leading thoughts obligations Mr.
Gardiner's behaviour laid under.

"For must attribute happy conclusion," added, "in great
measure kindness. We persuaded pledged
assist Mr. Wickham money."

"Well," cried mother, "it right;
uncle? If family own, I children
must money, know; first time
ever anything him, except presents. Well! I happy!
In short time I shall daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
sounds! And sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I
flutter, I sure I can't write; I dictate,
write me. We settle father money
afterwards; things ordered immediately."

She proceeding particulars calico, muslin,
cambric, would shortly dictated plentiful orders,
Jane, though difficulty, persuaded wait till
father leisure consulted. One day's delay, observed,
would small importance; mother happy quite
obstinate usual. Other schemes, too, came head.

"I go Meryton," said she, "as soon I dressed, tell
good, good news sister Philips. And I come back, I call
Lady Lucas Mrs. Long. Kitty, run order carriage.
An airing would great deal good, I sure. Girls, I
anything Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill,
heard good news? Miss Lydia going married; shall
bowl punch make merry wedding."

Mrs. Hill began instantly express joy. Elizabeth received
congratulations amongst rest, then, sick folly, took
refuge room, might think freedom.

Poor Lydia's situation must, best, bad enough;
worse, need thankful. She felt so; though,
looking forward, neither rational happiness worldly prosperity could
justly expected sister, looking back
feared, two hours ago, felt advantages
gained.



Chapter 50


Mr. Bennet often wished period life that,
instead spending whole income, laid annual sum
better provision children, wife, survived
him. He wished ever. Had done duty
respect, Lydia need indebted uncle whatever
honour credit could purchased her. The satisfaction
prevailing one worthless young men Great Britain
husband might rested proper place.

He seriously concerned cause little advantage anyone
forwarded sole expense brother-in-law,
determined, possible, find extent assistance,
discharge obligation soon could.

When first Mr. Bennet married, economy held perfectly
useless, for, course, son. The son join
cutting entail, soon age, widow
younger children would means provided for. Five daughters
successively entered world, yet son come; Mrs.
Bennet, many years Lydia's birth, certain
would. This event last despaired of,
late saving. Mrs. Bennet turn economy,
husband's love independence alone prevented exceeding
income.

Five thousand pounds settled marriage articles Mrs. Bennet
children. But proportions divided amongst
latter depended parents. This one point,
regard Lydia, least, settled, Mr. Bennet
could hesitation acceding proposal him. In
terms grateful acknowledgment kindness brother,
though expressed concisely, delivered paper perfect
approbation done, willingness fulfil
engagements made him. He never supposed
that, could Wickham prevailed marry daughter, would
done little inconvenience present
arrangement. He would scarcely ten pounds year loser
hundred paid them; for, board pocket
allowance, continual presents money passed
mother's hands, Lydia's expenses little within
sum.

That would done trifling exertion side, too,
another welcome surprise; wish present
little trouble business possible. When first transports
rage produced activity seeking over,
naturally returned former indolence. His letter soon
dispatched; for, though dilatory undertaking business, quick
execution. He begged know particulars
indebted brother, angry Lydia send
message her.

The good news spread quickly house, proportionate
speed neighbourhood. It borne latter decent
philosophy. To sure, would advantage
conversation Miss Lydia Bennet come upon town; or,
happiest alternative, secluded world, distant
farmhouse. But much talked marrying her;
good-natured wishes well-doing proceeded
spiteful old ladies Meryton lost little spirit
change circumstances, husband misery
considered certain.

It fortnight since Mrs. Bennet downstairs;
happy day took seat head table,
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment shame gave damp
triumph. The marriage daughter, first object
wishes since Jane sixteen, point
accomplishment, thoughts words ran wholly
attendants elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages,
servants. She busily searching neighbourhood
proper situation daughter, and, without knowing considering
income might be, rejected many deficient size
importance.

"Haye Park might do," said she, "if Gouldings could quit it--or
great house Stoke, drawing-room larger; Ashworth
far off! I could bear ten miles me;
Pulvis Lodge, attics dreadful."

Her husband allowed talk without interruption
servants remained. But withdrawn, said her: "Mrs.
Bennet, take houses son
daughter, let us come right understanding. Into _one_ house
neighbourhood shall never admittance. I encourage
impudence either, receiving Longbourn."

A long dispute followed declaration; Mr. Bennet firm. It
soon led another; Mrs. Bennet found, amazement horror,
husband would advance guinea buy clothes
daughter. He protested receive mark
affection whatever occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. That anger could carried point inconceivable
resentment refuse daughter privilege without
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded could believe
possible. She alive disgrace want new
clothes must reflect daughter's nuptials, sense
shame eloping living Wickham fortnight
took place.

Elizabeth heartily sorry had, distress
moment, led make Mr. Darcy acquainted fears
sister; since marriage would shortly give
proper termination elopement, might hope conceal
unfavourable beginning immediately
spot.

She fear spreading farther means. There
people whose secrecy would confidently depended;
but, time, one whose knowledge sister's
frailty would mortified much--not, however, fear
disadvantage individually herself, for, rate,
seemed gulf impassable them. Had Lydia's marriage
concluded honourable terms, supposed
Mr. Darcy would connect family where, every
objection, would added alliance relationship
nearest kind man justly scorned.

From connection could wonder would shrink. The
wish procuring regard, assured
feeling Derbyshire, could rational expectation survive
blow this. She humbled, grieved; repented, though
hardly knew what. She became jealous esteem, could
longer hope benefited it. She wanted hear him,
seemed least chance gaining intelligence. She convinced
could happy him, longer likely
meet.

What triumph him, often thought, could know
proposals proudly spurned four months ago, would
gladly gratefully received! He generous,
doubted not, generous sex; mortal,
must triumph.

She began comprehend exactly man who,
disposition talents, would suit her. His understanding
temper, though unlike own, would answered wishes. It
union must advantage both; ease
liveliness, mind might softened, manners improved;
judgement, information, knowledge world,
must received benefit greater importance.

But happy marriage could teach admiring multitude
connubial felicity really was. An union different tendency,
precluding possibility other, soon formed
family.

How Wickham Lydia supported tolerable independence,
could imagine. But little permanent happiness could
belong couple brought together passions
stronger virtue, could easily conjecture.

Mr. Gardiner soon wrote brother. To Mr. Bennet's
acknowledgments briefly replied, assurance eagerness
promote welfare family; concluded entreaties
subject might never mentioned again. The principal
purport letter inform Mr. Wickham resolved
quitting militia.

"It greatly wish so," added, "as soon

Mr. Bennet daughters saw advantages Wickham's removal
----shire clearly Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet
well pleased it. Lydia's settled North,
expected pleasure pride company,
means given plan residing
Hertfordshire, severe disappointment; and, besides,
pity Lydia taken regiment acquainted
everybody, many favourites.

"She fond Mrs. Forster," said she, "it quite shocking

likes much. The officers may pleasant General ----'s
regiment."

His daughter's request, might considered,
admitted family set North,
received first absolute negative. But Jane Elizabeth,

urged earnestly yet rationally mildly, receive
husband Longbourn, soon married,

permission come; settled, soon

surprised, however, Wickham consent scheme,
consulted inclination, meeting would
last object wishes.



Chapter 51


Their sister's wedding day arrived; Jane Elizabeth felt
probably felt herself. The carriage sent
meet ----, return dinner-time. Their
arrival dreaded elder Miss Bennets, Jane especially,
gave Lydia feelings would attended herself,
culprit, wretched thought sister
must endure.

They came. The family assembled breakfast room receive
them. Smiles decked face Mrs. Bennet carriage drove
door; husband looked impenetrably grave; daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.

Lydia's voice heard vestibule; door thrown open,
ran room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her,
welcomed rapture; gave hand, affectionate smile,
Wickham, followed lady; wished joy
alacrity shewed doubt happiness.

Their reception Mr. Bennet, turned, quite
cordial. His countenance rather gained austerity; scarcely
opened lips. The easy assurance young couple, indeed,
enough provoke him. Elizabeth disgusted, even Miss Bennet
shocked. Lydia Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,
fearless. She turned sister sister, demanding
congratulations; length sat down, looked eagerly
round room, took notice little alteration it,
observed, laugh, great since
there.

Wickham distressed herself, manners
always pleasing, character marriage
exactly ought, smiles easy address,
claimed relationship, would delighted all. Elizabeth
believed quite equal assurance; sat down,
resolving within draw limits future impudence
impudent man. She blushed, Jane blushed; cheeks
two caused confusion suffered variation colour.

There want discourse. The bride mother could neither
talk fast enough; Wickham, happened sit near
Elizabeth, began inquiring acquaintance neighbourhood,
good humoured ease felt unable equal
replies. They seemed happiest memories
world. Nothing past recollected pain; Lydia led
voluntarily subjects sisters would alluded
world.

"Only think three months," cried, "since I went away;
seems fortnight I declare; yet things
enough happened time. Good gracious! I went away, I sure
I idea married till I came back again! though I
thought would good fun I was."

Her father lifted eyes. Jane distressed. Elizabeth looked
expressively Lydia; she, never heard saw anything
chose insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma,
people hereabouts know I married to-day? I afraid might not;
overtook William Goulding curricle, I determined
know it, I let side-glass next him, took
glove, let hand rest upon window frame,
might see ring, I bowed smiled like anything."

Elizabeth could bear longer. She got up, ran room;
returned more, till heard passing hall
dining parlour. She joined soon enough see Lydia,
anxious parade, walk mother's right hand, hear say
eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take place now, must go
lower, I married woman."

It supposed time would give Lydia embarrassment
wholly free first. Her ease good
spirits increased. She longed see Mrs. Phillips, Lucases,
neighbours, hear called "Mrs. Wickham"
them; mean time, went dinner show
ring, boast married, Mrs. Hill two housemaids.

"Well, mamma," said she, returned breakfast
room, "and think husband? Is charming man? I
sure sisters must envy me. I hope may half
good luck. They must go Brighton. That place get
husbands. What pity is, mamma, go."

"Very true; I will, should. But dear Lydia, I
like going way off. Must so?"

"Oh, lord! yes;--there nothing that. I shall like
things. You papa, sisters, must come see us. We
shall Newcastle winter, I dare say
balls, I take care get good partners all."

"I like beyond anything!" said mother.

"And go away, may leave one two sisters
behind you; I dare say I shall get husbands
winter over."

"I thank share favour," said Elizabeth; "but I
particularly like way getting husbands."

Their visitors remain ten days them. Mr. Wickham
received commission left London, join
regiment end fortnight.

No one Mrs. Bennet regretted stay would short;
made time visiting daughter,
frequent parties home. These parties acceptable
all; avoid family circle even desirable
think, not.

Wickham's affection Lydia Elizabeth expected
find it; equal Lydia's him. She scarcely needed
present observation satisfied, reason things,
elopement brought strength love, rather
his; would wondered why, without violently caring
her, chose elope all, felt certain
flight rendered necessary distress circumstances;
case, young man resist opportunity
companion.

Lydia exceedingly fond him. He dear Wickham every
occasion; one put competition him. He every
thing best world; sure would kill birds
first September, body else country.

One morning, soon arrival, sitting two
elder sisters, said Elizabeth:

"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ account wedding, I believe. You
by, I told mamma others it. Are
curious hear managed?"

"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think cannot little said
subject."

"La! You strange! But I must tell went off. We
married, know, St. Clement's, Wickham's lodgings
parish. And settled eleven
o'clock. My uncle aunt I go together; others
meet us church. Well, Monday morning came, I
fuss! I afraid, know, something would happen
put off, I gone quite distracted. And
aunt, time I dressing, preaching talking away
reading sermon. However, I hear one word
ten, I thinking, may suppose, dear Wickham. I longed
know whether would married blue coat."

"Well, breakfasted ten usual; I thought would never
over; for, bye, understand, uncle aunt
horrid unpleasant time I them. If believe
me, I put foot doors, though I
fortnight. Not one party, scheme, anything. To sure London
rather thin, but, however, Little Theatre open. Well,
carriage came door, uncle called away upon
business horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, know,
get together, end it. Well, I frightened I
know do, uncle give away;
beyond hour, could married day. But, luckily,
came back ten minutes' time, set out. However,
I recollected afterwards prevented going,
wedding need put off, Mr. Darcy might done well."

"Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, utter amazement.

"Oh, yes!--he come Wickham, know. But gracious
me! I quite forgot! I ought said word it. I promised
faithfully! What Wickham say? It secret!"

"If secret," said Jane, "say another word
subject. You may depend upon seeking further."

"Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning curiosity; "we
ask questions."

"Thank you," said Lydia, "for did, I certainly tell
all, Wickham would angry."

On encouragement ask, Elizabeth forced put
power, running away.

But live ignorance point impossible; least
impossible try information. Mr. Darcy
sister's wedding. It exactly scene, exactly among people,
apparently least do, least temptation go.
Conjectures meaning it, rapid wild, hurried
brain; satisfied none. Those best pleased her,
placing conduct noblest light, seemed improbable. She
could bear suspense; hastily seizing sheet paper,
wrote short letter aunt, request explanation
Lydia dropt, compatible secrecy
intended.

"You may readily comprehend," added, "what curiosity must
know person unconnected us, (comparatively
speaking) stranger family, amongst
time. Pray write instantly, let understand it--unless is,
cogent reasons, remain secrecy Lydia seems
think necessary; I must endeavour satisfied
ignorance."

"Not I _shall_, though," added herself, finished
letter; "and dear aunt, tell honourable
manner, I shall certainly reduced tricks stratagems find
out."

Jane's delicate sense honour would allow speak
Elizabeth privately Lydia let fall; Elizabeth glad
it;--till appeared whether inquiries would receive
satisfaction, rather without confidante.

Elizabeth satisfaction receiving answer letter
soon possibly could. She sooner possession
than, hurrying little copse, least likely
interrupted, sat one benches prepared
happy; length letter convinced
contain denial.

"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.

"MY DEAR NIECE,

"I received letter, shall devote whole morning

however, I mean let know I imagined
inquiries necessary _your_ side. If choose

I am--and nothing belief party concerned
would allowed act done. But really
innocent ignorant, I must explicit.

"On day coming home Longbourn, uncle
unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, shut several
hours. It I arrived; curiosity
dreadfully racked _yours_ seems been. He came tell Mr.
Gardiner found sister Mr. Wickham were,
seen talked both; Wickham repeatedly,
Lydia once. From I collect, left Derbyshire one day
ourselves, came town resolution hunting
them. The motive professed conviction owing
Wickham's worthlessness well known
make impossible young woman character love confide
him. He generously imputed whole mistaken pride,
confessed thought beneath lay private
actions open world. His character speak itself. He
called it, therefore, duty step forward, endeavour remedy
evil brought himself. If _had another_
motive, I sure would never disgrace him. He days
town, able discover them; something
direct search, _we_ had; consciousness
another reason resolving follow us.

"There lady, seems, Mrs. Younge, time ago
governess Miss Darcy, dismissed charge cause
disapprobation, though say what. She took large
house Edward-street, since maintained letting
lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, knew, intimately acquainted
Wickham; went intelligence soon got
town. But two three days could get
wanted. She would betray trust, I suppose, without bribery
corruption, really know friend found.
Wickham indeed gone first arrival London,
able receive house, would taken
abode her. At length, however, kind friend procured
wished-for direction. They ---- street. He saw Wickham,
afterwards insisted seeing Lydia. His first object her,
acknowledged, persuade quit present disgraceful
situation, return friends soon could prevailed
receive her, offering assistance, far would go. But
found Lydia absolutely resolved remaining was. She cared
none friends; wanted help his; would hear
leaving Wickham. She sure married time
other, much signify when. Since feelings,
remained, thought, secure expedite marriage, which,
first conversation Wickham, easily learnt never
_his_ design. He confessed obliged leave regiment,
account debts honour, pressing;
scrupled lay ill-consequences Lydia's flight
folly alone. He meant resign commission immediately;
future situation, could conjecture little it. He
must go somewhere, know where, knew
nothing live on.

"Mr. Darcy asked married sister once. Though
Mr. Bennet imagined rich, would able
something him, situation must benefited
marriage. But found, reply question, Wickham still
cherished hope effectually making fortune marriage
country. Under circumstances, however, likely
proof temptation immediate relief.

"They met several times, much discussed. Wickham
course wanted could get; length reduced
reasonable.

"Every thing settled _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step
make uncle acquainted it, first called Gracechurch
street evening I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could
seen, Mr. Darcy found, inquiry, father
still him, would quit town next morning. He judge
father person could properly consult
uncle, therefore readily postponed seeing till
departure former. He leave name, till next
day known gentleman called business.

"On Saturday came again. Your father gone, uncle home,
and, I said before, great deal talk together.

"They met Sunday, _I_ saw too. It
settled Monday: soon was, express sent
Longbourn. But visitor obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy,
obstinacy real defect character, all. He
accused many faults different times, _this_ true one.
Nothing done himself; though I sure (and
I speak thanked, therefore say nothing it),
uncle would readily settled whole.

"They battled together long time, either
gentleman lady concerned deserved. But last uncle
forced yield, instead allowed use
niece, forced put probable credit it,
went sorely grain; I really believe letter
morning gave great pleasure, required explanation
would rob borrowed feathers, give praise
due. But, Lizzy, must go farther yourself, Jane
most.

"You know pretty well, I suppose, done young
people. His debts paid, amounting, I believe, considerably
thousand pounds, another thousand addition
settled upon _her_, commission purchased. The reason

_this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, _anybody's_ reserve,
answerable event. But spite fine talking,
dear Lizzy, may rest perfectly assured uncle would
never yielded, given credit _another

"When resolved on, returned friends,
still staying Pemberley; agreed
London wedding took place, money matters
receive last finish.

"I believe I told every thing. It relation

sometimes quite provoked, I recollected dear Elizabeth

"Mr. Darcy punctual return, Lydia informed you,
attended wedding. He dined us next day, leave

dear Lizzy, I take opportunity saying (what I never bold
enough say before) much I like him. His behaviour us has,
every respect, pleasing Derbyshire. His
understanding opinions please me; wants nothing little

him. I thought sly;--he hardly ever mentioned name. But
slyness seems fashion.

"Pray forgive I presuming, least

"But I must write more. The children wanting half

"Yours, sincerely,

"M. GARDINER."

The contents letter threw Elizabeth flutter spirits,
difficult determine whether pleasure pain bore
greatest share. The vague unsettled suspicions uncertainty
produced Mr. Darcy might forward sister's
match, feared encourage exertion goodness
great probable, time dreaded just,
pain obligation, proved beyond greatest extent true!
He followed purposely town, taken
trouble mortification attendant research;
supplication necessary woman must abominate
despise, reduced meet, frequently meet, reason
with, persuade, finally bribe, man always wished
avoid, whose name punishment pronounce. He
done girl could neither regard esteem. Her

checked considerations, soon felt even vanity
insufficient, required depend affection her--for
woman already refused him--as able overcome sentiment
natural abhorrence relationship Wickham. Brother-in-law
Wickham! Every kind pride must revolt connection. He had,
sure, done much. She ashamed think much. But
given reason interference, asked extraordinary
stretch belief. It reasonable feel
wrong; liberality, means exercising it;
though would place principal inducement,
could, perhaps, believe remaining partiality might assist
endeavours cause peace mind must materially

owed restoration Lydia, character, every thing, him. Oh!
heartily grieve every ungracious sensation ever
encouraged, every saucy speech ever directed towards him. For
humbled; proud him. Proud cause
compassion honour, able get better himself.
She read aunt's commendation again. It
hardly enough; pleased her. She even sensible
pleasure, though mixed regret, finding steadfastly
uncle persuaded affection confidence subsisted
Mr. Darcy herself.

She roused seat, reflections, one's
approach; could strike another path,
overtaken Wickham.

"I afraid I interrupt solitary ramble, dear sister?" said he,
joined her.

"You certainly do," replied smile; "but follow
interruption must unwelcome."

"I sorry indeed, were. We always good friends;
better."

"True. Are others coming out?"

"I know. Mrs. Bennet Lydia going carriage
Meryton. And so, dear sister, I find, uncle aunt,
actually seen Pemberley."

She replied affirmative.

"I almost envy pleasure, yet I believe would much
me, else I could take way Newcastle. And saw
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, always fond
me. But course mention name you."

"Yes, did."

"And say?"

"That gone army, afraid had--not turned
well. At distance _that_, know, things strangely
misrepresented."

"Certainly," replied, biting lips. Elizabeth hoped
silenced him; soon afterwards said:

"I surprised see Darcy town last month. We passed
several times. I wonder there."

"Perhaps preparing marriage Miss de Bourgh," said
Elizabeth. "It must something particular, take
time year."

"Undoubtedly. Did see Lambton? I thought I
understood Gardiners had."

"Yes; introduced us sister."

"And like her?"

"Very much."

"I heard, indeed, uncommonly improved within year
two. When I last saw her, promising. I glad
liked her. I hope turn well."

"I dare say will; got trying age."

"Did go village Kympton?"

"I recollect did."

"I mention it, living I ought had. A
delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would suited
every respect."

"How liked making sermons?"

"Exceedingly well. I considered part duty,
exertion would soon nothing. One ought
repine;--but, sure, would thing me! The
quiet, retirement life would answered ideas
happiness! But be. Did ever hear Darcy mention
circumstance, Kent?"

"I heard authority, I thought _as good_,
left conditionally only, present patron."

"You have. Yes, something _that_; I told
first, may remember."

"I _did_ hear, too, time, sermon-making
palatable seems present; actually
declared resolution never taking orders, business
compromised accordingly."

"You did! wholly without foundation. You may remember
I told point, first talked it."

They almost door house, walked fast
get rid him; unwilling, sister's sake, provoke him,
said reply, good-humoured smile:

"Come, Mr. Wickham, brother sister, know. Do let
us quarrel past. In future, I hope shall always one
mind."

She held hand; kissed affectionate gallantry, though
hardly knew look, entered house.



Chapter 53


Mr. Wickham perfectly satisfied conversation
never distressed himself, provoked dear sister Elizabeth,
introducing subject it; pleased find
said enough keep quiet.

The day Lydia's departure soon came, Mrs. Bennet
forced submit separation, which, husband means
entered scheme going Newcastle, likely
continue least twelvemonth.

"Oh! dear Lydia," cried, "when shall meet again?"

"Oh, lord! I know. Not two three years, perhaps."

"Write often, dear."

"As often I can. But know married women never much time
writing. My sisters may write _me_. They nothing else
do."

Mr. Wickham's adieus much affectionate wife's. He
smiled, looked handsome, said many pretty things.

"He fine fellow," said Mr. Bennet, soon
house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, smirks, makes love
us all. I prodigiously proud him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
produce valuable son-in-law."

The loss daughter made Mrs. Bennet dull several days.

"I often think," said she, "that nothing bad parting
one's friends. One seems forlorn without them."

"This consequence, see, Madam, marrying daughter," said
Elizabeth. "It must make better satisfied four
single."

"It thing. Lydia leave married,
husband's regiment happens far off. If
nearer, would gone soon."

But spiritless condition event threw shortly
relieved, mind opened agitation hope,
article news began circulation. The housekeeper
Netherfield received orders prepare arrival
master, coming day two, shoot several
weeks. Mrs. Bennet quite fidgets. She looked Jane,
smiled shook head turns.

"Well, well, Mr. Bingley coming down, sister," (for Mrs.
Phillips first brought news). "Well, much better. Not
I care it, though. He nothing us, know, I
sure _I_ never want see again. But, however, welcome
come Netherfield, likes it. And knows _may_ happen?
But nothing us. You know, sister, agreed long ago never
mention word it. And so, quite certain coming?"

"You may depend it," replied other, "for Mrs. Nicholls
Meryton last night; I saw passing by, went purpose
know truth it; told certain true. He
comes Thursday latest, likely Wednesday. She
going butcher's, told me, purpose order meat
Wednesday, got three couple ducks fit killed."

Miss Bennet able hear coming without changing
colour. It many months since mentioned name
Elizabeth; now, soon alone together, said:

"I saw look to-day, Lizzy, aunt told us present
report; I know I appeared distressed. But imagine
silly cause. I confused moment, I felt
I _should_ looked at. I assure news affect
either pleasure pain. I glad one thing, comes
alone; shall see less him. Not I afraid
_myself_, I dread people's remarks."

Elizabeth know make it. Had seen
Derbyshire, might supposed capable coming
view acknowledged; still thought partial
Jane, wavered greater probability coming
_with_ friend's permission, bold enough come
without it.

"Yet hard," sometimes thought, "that poor man cannot
come house legally hired, without raising
speculation! I _will_ leave himself."

In spite sister declared, really believed
feelings expectation arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive spirits affected it. They disturbed,
unequal, often seen them.

The subject warmly canvassed parents,
twelvemonth ago, brought forward again.

"As soon ever Mr. Bingley comes, dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you
wait course."

"No, no. You forced visiting last year, promised, I
went see him, marry one daughters. But ended
nothing, I sent fool's errand again."

His wife represented absolutely necessary attention
would neighbouring gentlemen, returning
Netherfield.

"'Tis etiquette I despise," said he. "If wants society,
let seek it. He knows live. I spend hours
running neighbours every time go away come back
again."

"Well, I know is, abominably rude wait
him. But, however, prevent asking dine here, I
determined. We must Mrs. Long Gouldings soon. That
make thirteen ourselves, room table
him."

Consoled resolution, better able bear
husband's incivility; though mortifying know
neighbours might see Mr. Bingley, consequence it,
_they_ did. As day arrival drew near,--

"I begin sorry comes all," said Jane sister. "It
would nothing; I could see perfect indifference, I
hardly bear hear thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
know, one know, much I suffer
says. Happy shall I be, stay Netherfield over!"

"I wish I could say anything comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but
wholly power. You must feel it; usual satisfaction
preaching patience sufferer denied me,
always much."

Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, assistance servants,
contrived earliest tidings it, period anxiety
fretfulness side might long could. She counted
days must intervene invitation could sent;
hopeless seeing before. But third morning
arrival Hertfordshire, saw him, dressing-room window,
enter paddock ride towards house.

Her daughters eagerly called partake joy. Jane resolutely
kept place table; Elizabeth, satisfy mother, went
window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy him, sat
sister.

"There gentleman him, mamma," said Kitty; "who be?"

"Some acquaintance other, dear, I suppose; I sure I
know."

"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks like man used
before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man."

"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and does, I vow. Well, friend
Mr. Bingley's always welcome here, sure; else I must
say I hate sight him."

Jane looked Elizabeth surprise concern. She knew little
meeting Derbyshire, therefore felt awkwardness
must attend sister, seeing almost first time
receiving explanatory letter. Both sisters uncomfortable
enough. Each felt other, course themselves;
mother talked on, dislike Mr. Darcy, resolution
civil Mr. Bingley's friend, without heard either
them. But Elizabeth sources uneasiness could
suspected Jane, never yet courage shew Mrs.
Gardiner's letter, relate change sentiment towards him.
To Jane, could man whose proposals refused,
whose merit undervalued; extensive
information, person whole family indebted
first benefits, regarded
interest, quite tender, least reasonable
Jane felt Bingley. Her astonishment coming--at
coming Netherfield, Longbourn, voluntarily seeking again,
almost equal known first witnessing altered
behaviour Derbyshire.

The colour driven face, returned half
minute additional glow, smile delight added lustre
eyes, thought space time affection
wishes must still unshaken. But would secure.

"Let first see behaves," said she; "it early
enough expectation."

She sat intently work, striving composed, without daring
lift eyes, till anxious curiosity carried face
sister servant approaching door. Jane looked little
paler usual, sedate Elizabeth expected. On
gentlemen's appearing, colour increased; yet received
tolerable ease, propriety behaviour equally free
symptom resentment unnecessary complaisance.

Elizabeth said little either civility would allow, sat
work, eagerness often command. She
ventured one glance Darcy. He looked serious, usual; and,
thought, used look Hertfordshire,
seen Pemberley. But, perhaps could mother's
presence uncle aunt. It painful,
improbable, conjecture.

Bingley, likewise seen instant, short period
saw looking pleased embarrassed. He received Mrs.
Bennet degree civility made two daughters ashamed,
especially contrasted cold ceremonious politeness
curtsey address friend.

Elizabeth, particularly, knew mother owed latter
preservation favourite daughter irremediable infamy,
hurt distressed painful degree distinction ill
applied.

Darcy, inquiring Mr. Mrs. Gardiner did, question
could answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He
seated her; perhaps reason silence;
Derbyshire. There talked friends,
could herself. But several minutes elapsed without
bringing sound voice; occasionally, unable resist
impulse curiosity, raised eyes face, often
found looking Jane herself, frequently object
ground. More thoughtfulness less anxiety please,
last met, plainly expressed. She disappointed, angry
so.

"Could I expect otherwise!" said she. "Yet come?"

She humour conversation anyone himself;
hardly courage speak.

She inquired sister, could more.

"It long time, Mr. Bingley, since went away," said Mrs. Bennet.

He readily agreed it.

"I began afraid would never come back again. People _did_ say
meant quit place entirely Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
true. A great many changes happened neighbourhood,
since went away. Miss Lucas married settled. And one
daughters. I suppose heard it; indeed, must
seen papers. It The Times The Courier, I know;
though put ought be. It said, 'Lately,
George Wickham, Esq. Miss Lydia Bennet,' without
syllable said father, place lived, anything.
It brother Gardiner's drawing too, I wonder came
make awkward business it. Did see it?"

Bingley replied did, made congratulations. Elizabeth
dared lift eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, could
tell.

"It delightful thing, sure, daughter well married,"
continued mother, "but time, Mr. Bingley,
hard taken way me. They gone
Newcastle, place quite northward, seems, stay
I know long. His regiment there; I suppose
heard leaving ----shire, gone
regulars. Thank Heaven! _some_ friends, though perhaps
many deserves."

Elizabeth, knew levelled Mr. Darcy,
misery shame, could hardly keep seat. It drew her,
however, exertion speaking, nothing else effectually
done before; asked Bingley whether meant make stay
country present. A weeks, believed.

"When killed birds, Mr. Bingley," said mother,
"I beg come here, shoot many please Mr.
Bennet's manor. I sure vastly happy oblige you,
save best covies you."

Elizabeth's misery increased, unnecessary, officious
attention! Were fair prospect arise present
flattered year ago, every thing, persuaded, would
hastening vexatious conclusion. At instant, felt
years happiness could make Jane amends
moments painful confusion.

"The first wish heart," said herself, "is never
company either them. Their society afford pleasure
atone wretchedness this! Let never see either
one again!"

Yet misery, years happiness offer
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, observing
much beauty sister re-kindled admiration
former lover. When first came in, spoken little;
every five minutes seemed giving attention. He
found handsome last year; good natured,
unaffected, though quite chatty. Jane anxious
difference perceived all, really persuaded
talked much ever. But mind busily engaged,
always know silent.

When gentlemen rose go away, Mrs. Bennet mindful
intended civility, invited engaged dine
Longbourn days time.

"You quite visit debt, Mr. Bingley," added, "for
went town last winter, promised take family dinner
us, soon returned. I forgot, see; I assure
you, I much disappointed come back keep
engagement."

Bingley looked little silly reflection, said something
concern prevented business. They went away.

Mrs. Bennet strongly inclined ask stay dine
day; but, though always kept good table,
think anything less two courses could good enough man
anxious designs, satisfy appetite pride
one ten thousand year.



Chapter 54


As soon gone, Elizabeth walked recover spirits;
words, dwell without interruption subjects
must deaden more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished vexed her.

"Why, came silent, grave, indifferent," said she,
"did come all?"

She could settle way gave pleasure.

"He could still amiable, still pleasing, uncle aunt,
town; me? If fears me, come hither? If
longer cares me, silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I
think him."

Her resolution short time involuntarily kept approach
sister, joined cheerful look, showed
better satisfied visitors, Elizabeth.

"Now," said she, "that first meeting over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know strength, I shall never embarrassed
coming. I glad dines Tuesday. It publicly
seen that, sides, meet common indifferent
acquaintance."

"Yes, indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. "Oh, Jane,
take care."

"My dear Lizzy, cannot think weak, danger now?"

"I think great danger making much love
ever."

* * * * *

They see gentlemen till Tuesday; Mrs. Bennet,
meanwhile, giving way happy schemes, good
humour common politeness Bingley, half hour's visit,
revived.

On Tuesday large party assembled Longbourn; two
anxiously expected, credit punctuality
sportsmen, good time. When repaired
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched see whether Bingley would take
place, which, former parties, belonged him,
sister. Her prudent mother, occupied ideas, forbore
invite sit herself. On entering room, seemed
hesitate; Jane happened look round, happened smile:
decided. He placed her.

Elizabeth, triumphant sensation, looked towards friend.
He bore noble indifference, would imagined
Bingley received sanction happy, seen eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, expression half-laughing
alarm.

His behaviour sister such, dinner time, showed
admiration her, which, though guarded formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, left wholly himself, Jane's happiness,
own, would speedily secured. Though dared depend upon
consequence, yet received pleasure observing behaviour. It
gave animation spirits could boast;
cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy almost far table
could divide them. He one side mother. She knew little
situation would give pleasure either, make either appear
advantage. She near enough hear discourse,
could see seldom spoke other, formal
cold manner whenever did. Her mother's ungraciousness,
made sense owed painful Elizabeth's mind;
would, times, given anything privileged tell
kindness neither unknown unfelt whole
family.

She hopes evening would afford opportunity
bringing together; whole visit would pass away
without enabling enter something conversation
mere ceremonious salutation attending entrance. Anxious
uneasy, period passed drawing-room,
gentlemen came, wearisome dull degree almost made
uncivil. She looked forward entrance point
chance pleasure evening must depend.

"If come me, _then_," said she, "I shall give
ever."

The gentlemen came; thought looked would
answered hopes; but, alas! ladies crowded round table,
Miss Bennet making tea, Elizabeth pouring coffee,
close confederacy single vacancy near
would admit chair. And gentlemen's approaching, one
girls moved closer ever, said, whisper:

"The men come part us, I determined. We want none them;
we?"

Darcy walked away another part room. She followed
eyes, envied everyone spoke, scarcely patience enough
help anybody coffee; enraged
silly!

"A man refused! How could I ever foolish enough
expect renewal love? Is one among sex, would
protest weakness second proposal woman?
There indignity abhorrent feelings!"

She little revived, however, bringing back coffee cup
himself; seized opportunity saying:

"Is sister Pemberley still?"

"Yes, remain till Christmas."

"And quite alone? Have friends left her?"

"Mrs. Annesley her. The others gone Scarborough,
three weeks."

She could think nothing say; wished converse
her, might better success. He stood her, however,
minutes, silence; and, last, young lady's whispering
Elizabeth again, walked away.

When tea-things removed, card-tables placed, ladies
rose, Elizabeth hoping soon joined him,
views overthrown seeing fall victim
mother's rapacity whist players, moments seated
rest party. She lost every expectation pleasure.
They confined evening different tables,
nothing hope, eyes often turned towards side
room, make play unsuccessfully herself.

Mrs. Bennet designed keep two Netherfield gentlemen
supper; carriage unluckily ordered
others, opportunity detaining them.

"Well girls," said she, soon left themselves, "What
say day? I think every thing passed uncommonly well,
I assure you. The dinner well dressed I ever saw. The
venison roasted turn--and everybody said never saw
fat haunch. The soup fifty times better
Lucases' last week; even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, partridges
remarkably well done; I suppose two three French
cooks least. And, dear Jane, I never saw look greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said too, I asked whether not. And
think said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, shall
Netherfield last.' She indeed. I think Mrs. Long good
creature ever lived--and nieces pretty behaved girls,
handsome: I like prodigiously."

Mrs. Bennet, short, great spirits; seen enough
Bingley's behaviour Jane, convinced would get
last; expectations advantage family, happy
humour, far beyond reason, quite disappointed
seeing next day, make proposals.

"It agreeable day," said Miss Bennet Elizabeth. "The
party seemed well selected, suitable one other. I hope
may often meet again."

Elizabeth smiled.

"Lizzy, must so. You must suspect me. It mortifies me.
I assure I learnt enjoy conversation
agreeable sensible young man, without wish beyond it. I
perfectly satisfied, manners are, never
design engaging affection. It blessed
greater sweetness address, stronger desire generally
pleasing, man."

"You cruel," said sister, "you let smile,
provoking every moment."

"How hard cases believed!"

"And impossible others!"

"But wish persuade I feel I
acknowledge?"

"That question I hardly know answer. We love
instruct, though teach worth knowing. Forgive
me; persist indifference, make confidante."



Chapter 55


A days visit, Mr. Bingley called again, alone. His
friend left morning London, return home
ten days time. He sat hour, remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited dine them; but, many
expressions concern, confessed engaged elsewhere.

"Next time call," said she, "I hope shall lucky."

He particularly happy time, etc. etc.; would
give leave, would take early opportunity waiting them.

"Can come to-morrow?"

Yes, engagement to-morrow; invitation
accepted alacrity.

He came, good time ladies none
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet daughter's room, dressing
gown, hair half finished, crying out:

"My dear Jane, make haste hurry down. He come--Mr. Bingley
come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come Miss
Bennet moment, help gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair."

"We soon can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty
forwarder either us, went stairs half hour ago."

"Oh! hang Kitty! it? Come quick, quick!
Where sash, dear?"

But mother gone, Jane would prevailed go
without one sisters.

The anxiety get visible
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired library,
custom, Mary went stairs instrument. Two obstacles
five thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking winking
Elizabeth Catherine considerable time, without making
impression them. Elizabeth would observe her; last
Kitty did, innocently said, "What matter mamma? What
keep winking for? What I do?"

"Nothing child, nothing. I wink you." She sat still
five minutes longer; unable waste precious occasion,
suddenly got up, saying Kitty, "Come here, love, I want
speak you," took room. Jane instantly gave look
Elizabeth spoke distress premeditation,
entreaty _she_ would give it. In minutes, Mrs.
Bennet half-opened door called out:

"Lizzy, dear, I want speak you."

Elizabeth forced go.

"We may well leave know;" said mother,
soon hall. "Kitty I going stairs sit
dressing-room."

Elizabeth made attempt reason mother, remained
quietly hall, till Kitty sight, returned
drawing-room.

Mrs. Bennet's schemes day ineffectual. Bingley every
thing charming, except professed lover daughter. His
ease cheerfulness rendered agreeable addition
evening party; bore ill-judged officiousness
mother, heard silly remarks forbearance command
countenance particularly grateful daughter.

He scarcely needed invitation stay supper; went
away, engagement formed, chiefly Mrs.
Bennet's means, coming next morning shoot husband.

After day, Jane said indifference. Not word passed
sisters concerning Bingley; Elizabeth went bed
happy belief must speedily concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within stated time. Seriously, however, felt tolerably
persuaded must taken place gentleman's
concurrence.

Bingley punctual appointment; Mr. Bennet spent
morning together, agreed on. The latter much
agreeable companion expected. There nothing presumption
folly Bingley could provoke ridicule, disgust
silence; communicative, less eccentric,
ever seen him. Bingley course returned dinner;
evening Mrs. Bennet's invention work get
every body away daughter. Elizabeth, letter
write, went breakfast room purpose soon tea;
others going sit cards, could
wanted counteract mother's schemes.

But returning drawing-room, letter finished,
saw, infinite surprise, reason fear mother
ingenious her. On opening door, perceived
sister Bingley standing together hearth, engaged
earnest conversation; led suspicion, faces
both, hastily turned round moved away other, would
told all. Their situation awkward enough; _hers_
thought still worse. Not syllable uttered either;
Elizabeth point going away again, Bingley,
well sat down, suddenly rose, whispering
words sister, ran room.

Jane could reserves Elizabeth, confidence would give
pleasure; instantly embracing her, acknowledged, liveliest
emotion, happiest creature world.

"'Tis much!" added, "by far much. I deserve it. Oh!
everybody happy?"

Elizabeth's congratulations given sincerity, warmth,
delight, words could poorly express. Every sentence
kindness fresh source happiness Jane. But would
allow stay sister, say half remained
said present.

"I must go instantly mother;" cried. "I would
account trifle affectionate solicitude; allow hear
anyone myself. He gone father already. Oh! Lizzy,
know I relate give pleasure dear
family! shall I bear much happiness!"

She hastened away mother, purposely broken
card party, sitting stairs Kitty.

Elizabeth, left herself, smiled rapidity ease
affair finally settled, given many
previous months suspense vexation.

"And this," said she, "is end friend's anxious
circumspection! sister's falsehood contrivance!
happiest, wisest, reasonable end!"

In minutes joined Bingley, whose conference
father short purpose.

"Where sister?" said hastily, opened door.

"With mother stairs. She moment, I dare say."

He shut door, and, coming her, claimed good wishes
affection sister. Elizabeth honestly heartily expressed
delight prospect relationship. They shook hands
great cordiality; then, till sister came down, listen
say happiness, Jane's perfections;
spite lover, Elizabeth really believed
expectations felicity rationally founded,
basis excellent understanding, super-excellent disposition
Jane, general similarity feeling taste
himself.

It evening common delight all; satisfaction
Miss Bennet's mind gave glow sweet animation face,
made look handsomer ever. Kitty simpered smiled, hoped
turn coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could give consent
speak approbation terms warm enough satisfy feelings,
though talked Bingley nothing else half hour;
Mr. Bennet joined supper, voice manner plainly showed
really happy was.

Not word, however, passed lips allusion it, till
visitor took leave night; soon gone,
turned daughter, said:

"Jane, I congratulate you. You happy woman."

Jane went instantly, kissed him, thanked
goodness.

"You good girl;" replied, "and I great pleasure
thinking happily settled. I doubt
well together. Your tempers means unlike. You
complying, nothing ever resolved on;
easy, every servant cheat you; generous,
always exceed income."

"I hope so. Imprudence thoughtlessness money matters would
unpardonable me."

"Exceed income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried wife, "what
talking of? Why, four five thousand year, likely
more." Then addressing daughter, "Oh! dear, dear Jane, I
happy! I sure I get wink sleep night. I knew
would be. I always said must so, last. I sure could
beautiful nothing! I remember, soon ever I saw him,
first came Hertfordshire last year, I thought likely
come together. Oh! handsomest young man
ever seen!"

Wickham, Lydia, forgotten. Jane beyond competition
favourite child. At moment, cared other. Her younger
sisters soon began make interest objects happiness
might future able dispense.

Mary petitioned use library Netherfield; Kitty
begged hard balls every winter.

Bingley, time, course daily visitor Longbourn;
coming frequently breakfast, always remaining till
supper; unless barbarous neighbour, could enough
detested, given invitation dinner thought
obliged accept.

Elizabeth little time conversation sister;
present, Jane attention bestow anyone else;
found considerably useful hours
separation must sometimes occur. In absence Jane,
always attached Elizabeth, pleasure talking
her; Bingley gone, Jane constantly sought means
relief.

"He made happy," said she, one evening, "by telling
totally ignorant town last spring! I believed
possible."

"I suspected much," replied Elizabeth. "But account
it?"

"It must sister's doing. They certainly friends
acquaintance me, I cannot wonder at, since might
chosen much advantageously many respects. But see,
I trust will, brother happy me,
learn contented, shall good terms again; though
never other."

"That unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever
heard utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, see
dupe Miss Bingley's pretended regard."

"Would believe it, Lizzy, went town last November,
really loved me, nothing persuasion _my_
indifferent would prevented coming again!"

"He made little mistake sure; credit
modesty."

This naturally introduced panegyric Jane diffidence,
little value put good qualities. Elizabeth pleased
find betrayed interference friend; for,
though Jane generous forgiving heart world,
knew circumstance must prejudice him.

"I certainly fortunate creature ever existed!" cried
Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, I thus singled family, blessed
all! If I could see _you_ happy! If _were_
another man you!"

"If give forty men, I never could happy
you. Till I disposition, goodness, I never
happiness. No, no, let shift myself; and, perhaps, I
good luck, I may meet another Mr. Collins time."

The situation affairs Longbourn family could long
secret. Mrs. Bennet privileged whisper Mrs. Phillips,
ventured, without permission,
neighbours Meryton.

The Bennets speedily pronounced luckiest family
world, though weeks before, Lydia first run away,
generally proved marked misfortune.



Chapter 56


One morning, week Bingley's engagement Jane
formed, females family sitting together
dining-room, attention suddenly drawn window,
sound carriage; perceived chaise four driving
lawn. It early morning visitors, besides,
equipage answer neighbours. The horses
post; neither carriage, livery servant
preceded it, familiar them. As certain, however,
somebody coming, Bingley instantly prevailed Miss Bennet avoid
confinement intrusion, walk away
shrubbery. They set off, conjectures remaining three
continued, though little satisfaction, till door thrown
open visitor entered. It Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

They course intending surprised;
astonishment beyond expectation; part Mrs.
Bennet Kitty, though perfectly unknown them, even
inferior Elizabeth felt.

She entered room air usually ungracious, made
reply Elizabeth's salutation slight inclination
head, sat without saying word. Elizabeth mentioned
name mother ladyship's entrance, though request
introduction made.

Mrs. Bennet, amazement, though flattered guest
high importance, received utmost politeness. After sitting
moment silence, said stiffly Elizabeth,

"I hope well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose,
mother."

Elizabeth replied concisely was.

"And _that_ I suppose one sisters."

"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted speak Lady Catherine.
"She youngest girl one. My youngest lately married,
eldest somewhere grounds, walking young man
who, I believe, soon become part family."

"You small park here," returned Lady Catherine short
silence.

"It nothing comparison Rosings, lady, I dare say; I
assure much larger Sir William Lucas's."

"This must inconvenient sitting room evening,
summer; windows full west."

Mrs. Bennet assured never sat dinner,
added:

"May I take liberty asking ladyship whether left Mr.
Mrs. Collins well."

"Yes, well. I saw night last."

Elizabeth expected would produce letter
Charlotte, seemed probable motive calling. But
letter appeared, completely puzzled.

Mrs. Bennet, great civility, begged ladyship take
refreshment; Lady Catherine resolutely, politely,
declined eating anything; then, rising up, said Elizabeth,

"Miss Bennet, seemed prettyish kind little wilderness
one side lawn. I glad take turn it,
favour company."

"Go, dear," cried mother, "and show ladyship
different walks. I think pleased hermitage."

Elizabeth obeyed, running room parasol,
attended noble guest downstairs. As passed
hall, Lady Catherine opened doors dining-parlour
drawing-room, pronouncing them, short survey, decent
looking rooms, walked on.

Her carriage remained door, Elizabeth saw
waiting-woman it. They proceeded silence along gravel walk
led copse; Elizabeth determined make effort
conversation woman usually insolent
disagreeable.

"How could I ever think like nephew?" said she, looked
face.

As soon entered copse, Lady Catherine began following
manner:--

"You loss, Miss Bennet, understand reason
journey hither. Your heart, conscience, must tell I
come."

Elizabeth looked unaffected astonishment.

"Indeed, mistaken, Madam. I able account
honour seeing here."

"Miss Bennet," replied ladyship, angry tone, "you ought
know, I trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose be, shall find _me_ so. My character ever
celebrated sincerity frankness, cause
moment this, I shall certainly depart it. A report
alarming nature reached two days ago. I told
sister point advantageously married,
you, Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, likelihood, soon
afterwards united nephew, nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ must scandalous falsehood, though I would injure
much suppose truth possible, I instantly resolved
setting place, I might make sentiments known
you."

"If believed impossible true," said Elizabeth, colouring
astonishment disdain, "I wonder took trouble coming
far. What could ladyship propose it?"

"At insist upon report universally contradicted."

"Your coming Longbourn, see family," said Elizabeth
coolly, "will rather confirmation it; if, indeed, report
existence."

"If! Do pretend ignorant it? Has
industriously circulated yourselves? Do know
report spread abroad?"

"I never heard was."

"And likewise declare, foundation it?"

"I pretend possess equal frankness ladyship. You may
ask questions I shall choose answer."

"This borne. Miss Bennet, I insist satisfied. Has
he, nephew, made offer marriage?"

"Your ladyship declared impossible."

"It ought so; must so, retains use
reason. But arts allurements may, moment infatuation,
made forget owes family. You
may drawn in."

"If I have, I shall last person confess it."

"Miss Bennet, know I am? I accustomed
language this. I almost nearest relation world,
entitled know dearest concerns."

"But entitled know mine; behaviour this,
ever induce explicit."

"Let rightly understood. This match,
presumption aspire, never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy
engaged daughter. Now say?"

"Only this; so, reason suppose
make offer me."

Lady Catherine hesitated moment, replied:

"The engagement peculiar kind. From infancy,
intended other. It favourite wish
_his_ mother, well hers. While cradles, planned
union: now, moment wishes sisters would
accomplished marriage, prevented young woman
inferior birth, importance world, wholly unallied
family! Do pay regard wishes friends? To
tacit engagement Miss de Bourgh? Are lost every feeling
propriety delicacy? Have heard say earliest
hours destined cousin?"

"Yes, I heard before. But me? If
objection marrying nephew, I shall certainly
kept knowing mother aunt wished
marry Miss de Bourgh. You much could planning
marriage. Its completion depended others. If Mr. Darcy neither
honour inclination confined cousin, make
another choice? And I choice, may I accept him?"

"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,
Miss Bennet, interest; expect noticed family
friends, wilfully act inclinations all. You
censured, slighted, despised, everyone connected him.
Your alliance disgrace; name never even mentioned
us."

"These heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But wife Mr.
Darcy must extraordinary sources happiness necessarily
attached situation, could, upon whole, cause
repine."

"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I ashamed you! Is gratitude
attentions last spring? Is nothing due
score? Let us sit down. You understand, Miss Bennet, I came
determined resolution carrying purpose;
I dissuaded it. I used submit person's
whims. I habit brooking disappointment."

"_That_ make ladyship's situation present pitiable;
effect me."

"I interrupted. Hear silence. My daughter
nephew formed other. They descended, maternal
side, noble line; and, father's, respectable,
honourable, ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune
sides splendid. They destined voice
every member respective houses; divide them?
The upstart pretensions young woman without family, connections,
fortune. Is endured! But must not, shall be. If
sensible good, would wish quit sphere
brought up."

"In marrying nephew, I consider quitting
sphere. He gentleman; I gentleman's daughter; far
equal."

"True. You _are_ gentleman's daughter. But mother?
Who uncles aunts? Do imagine ignorant
condition."

"Whatever connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if nephew
object them, nothing _you_."

"Tell all, engaged him?"

Though Elizabeth would not, mere purpose obliging Lady
Catherine, answered question, could say,
moment's deliberation:

"I not."

Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

"And promise me, never enter engagement?"

"I make promise kind."

"Miss Bennet I shocked astonished. I expected find
reasonable young woman. But deceive belief
I ever recede. I shall go away till given
assurance I require."

"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I intimidated
anything wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy marry
daughter; would giving wished-for promise make
marriage probable? Supposing attached me, would
refusing accept hand make wish bestow cousin?
Allow say, Lady Catherine, arguments
supported extraordinary application frivolous
application ill-judged. You widely mistaken character,
think I worked persuasions these. How far
nephew might approve interference affairs, I cannot tell;
certainly right concern mine. I must beg,
therefore, importuned farther subject."

"Not hasty, please. I means done. To
objections I already urged, I still another add. I
stranger particulars youngest sister's infamous
elopement. I know all; young man's marrying
patched-up business, expence father uncles. And
girl nephew's sister? Is husband, son
late father's steward, brother? Heaven earth!--of
thinking? Are shades Pemberley thus polluted?"

"You nothing say," resentfully answered.
"You insulted every possible method. I must beg return
house."

And rose spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, turned
back. Her ladyship highly incensed.

"You regard, then, honour credit nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do consider connection
must disgrace eyes everybody?"

"Lady Catherine, I nothing say. You know sentiments."

"You resolved him?"

"I said thing. I resolved act manner,
will, opinion, constitute happiness, without
reference _you_, person wholly unconnected me."

"It well. You refuse, then, oblige me. You refuse obey
claims duty, honour, gratitude. You determined ruin
opinion friends, make contempt world."

"Neither duty, honour, gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have
possible claim me, present instance. No principle either
would violated marriage Mr. Darcy. And regard
resentment family, indignation world, former
_were_ excited marrying me, would give one moment's
concern--and world general would much sense join
scorn."

"And real opinion! This final resolve! Very well.
I shall know act. Do imagine, Miss Bennet,
ambition ever gratified. I came try you. I hoped find
reasonable; but, depend upon it, I carry point."

In manner Lady Catherine talked on, till door
carriage, when, turning hastily round, added, "I take leave
you, Miss Bennet. I send compliments mother. You deserve
attention. I seriously displeased."

Elizabeth made answer; without attempting persuade
ladyship return house, walked quietly herself. She
heard carriage drive away proceeded stairs. Her mother
impatiently met door dressing-room, ask Lady
Catherine would come rest herself.

"She choose it," said daughter, "she would go."

"She fine-looking woman! calling prodigiously
civil! came, I suppose, tell us Collinses
well. She road somewhere, I dare say, so, passing
Meryton, thought might well call you. I suppose
nothing particular say you, Lizzy?"

Elizabeth forced give little falsehood here;
acknowledge substance conversation impossible.



Chapter 57


The discomposure spirits extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could easily overcome; could she, many
hours, learn think less incessantly. Lady Catherine,
appeared, actually taken trouble journey Rosings,
sole purpose breaking supposed engagement Mr.
Darcy. It rational scheme, sure! report
engagement could originate, Elizabeth loss imagine;
till recollected _his_ intimate friend Bingley,
_her_ sister Jane, enough, time
expectation one wedding made everybody eager another, supply
idea. She forgotten feel marriage
sister must bring frequently together. And neighbours
Lucas Lodge, therefore (for communication
Collinses, report, concluded, reached Lady Catherine),
set almost certain immediate, looked
forward possible future time.

In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, could help
feeling uneasiness possible consequence persisting
interference. From said resolution
prevent marriage, occurred Elizabeth must meditate
application nephew; _he_ might take similar
representation evils attached connection her, dared
pronounce. She knew exact degree affection
aunt, dependence judgment, natural suppose
thought much higher ladyship _she_ could do;
certain that, enumerating miseries marriage _one_,
whose immediate connections unequal own, aunt would
address weakest side. With notions dignity, would
probably feel arguments, Elizabeth appeared weak
ridiculous, contained much good sense solid reasoning.

If wavering do, often
seemed likely, advice entreaty near relation might
settle every doubt, determine happy dignity
unblemished could make him. In case would return more. Lady
Catherine might see way town; engagement
Bingley coming Netherfield must give way.

"If, therefore, excuse keeping promise come
friend within days," added, "I shall know understand
it. I shall give every expectation, every wish
constancy. If satisfied regretting me, might
obtained affections hand, I shall soon cease regret
all."

* * * * *

The surprise rest family, hearing visitor
been, great; obligingly satisfied it,
kind supposition appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity;
Elizabeth spared much teasing subject.

The next morning, going downstairs, met
father, came library letter hand.

"Lizzy," said he, "I going look you; come room."

She followed thither; curiosity know
tell heightened supposition manner
connected letter held. It suddenly struck
might Lady Catherine; anticipated dismay
consequent explanations.

She followed father fire place, sat down. He
said,

"I received letter morning astonished
exceedingly. As principally concerns yourself, ought know
contents. I know before, I two daughters brink
matrimony. Let congratulate important conquest."

The colour rushed Elizabeth's cheeks instantaneous
conviction letter nephew, instead aunt;
undetermined whether pleased explained
all, offended letter rather addressed
herself; father continued:

"You look conscious. Young ladies great penetration matters
these; I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, discover
name admirer. This letter Mr. Collins."

"From Mr. Collins! _he_ say?"

"Something much purpose course. He begins
congratulations approaching nuptials eldest daughter,
which, seems, told good-natured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall sport impatience, reading says
point. What relates yourself, follows: 'Having thus
offered sincere congratulations Mrs. Collins
happy event, let add short hint subject another;
advertised authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, presumed, long bear name Bennet,
elder sister resigned it, chosen partner fate may
reasonably looked one illustrious personages
land.'

"Can possibly guess, Lizzy, meant this?" 'This young
gentleman blessed, peculiar way, every thing heart
mortal desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, extensive
patronage. Yet spite temptations, let warn cousin
Elizabeth, yourself, evils may incur precipitate
closure gentleman's proposals, which, course,
inclined take immediate advantage of.'

"Have idea, Lizzy, gentleman is? But comes out:

"'My motive cautioning follows. We reason imagine
aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, look match
friendly eye.'

"_Mr. Darcy_, see, man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you. Could he, Lucases, pitched man within
circle acquaintance, whose name would given lie
effectually related? Mr. Darcy, never looks
woman see blemish, probably never looked
life! It admirable!"

Elizabeth tried join father's pleasantry, could force
one reluctant smile. Never wit directed manner
little agreeable her.

"Are diverted?"

"Oh! yes. Pray read on."

"'After mentioning likelihood marriage ladyship last
night, immediately, usual condescension, expressed
felt occasion; became apparent, score
family objections part cousin, would never give
consent termed disgraceful match. I thought duty
give speediest intelligence cousin,
noble admirer may aware about, run
hastily marriage properly sanctioned.' Mr.
Collins moreover adds, 'I truly rejoiced cousin Lydia's sad
business well hushed up, concerned
living together marriage took place generally
known. I must not, however, neglect duties station, refrain
declaring amazement hearing received young
couple house soon married. It
encouragement vice; I rector Longbourn, I
strenuously opposed it. You ought certainly forgive them,
Christian, never admit sight, allow
names mentioned hearing.' That notion Christian
forgiveness! The rest letter dear Charlotte's
situation, expectation young olive-branch. But, Lizzy,
look enjoy it. You going _missish_,
I hope, pretend affronted idle report. For
live, make sport neighbours, laugh
turn?"

"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I excessively diverted. But
strange!"

"Yes--_that_ makes amusing. Had fixed man
would nothing; _his_ perfect indifference, _your_
pointed dislike, make delightfully absurd! Much I abominate
writing, I would give Mr. Collins's correspondence
consideration. Nay, I read letter his, I cannot help giving
preference even Wickham, much I value impudence
hypocrisy son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, said Lady Catherine
report? Did call refuse consent?"

To question daughter replied laugh;
asked without least suspicion, distressed
repeating it. Elizabeth never loss make
feelings appear not. It necessary laugh,
would rather cried. Her father cruelly mortified her,
said Mr. Darcy's indifference, could nothing
wonder want penetration, fear perhaps, instead
seeing little, might fancied much.



Chapter 58


Instead receiving letter excuse friend,
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley do, able bring Darcy
Longbourn many days passed Lady Catherine's
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, Mrs. Bennet time
tell seen aunt, daughter sat
momentary dread, Bingley, wanted alone Jane, proposed
walking out. It agreed to. Mrs. Bennet
habit walking; Mary could never spare time; remaining five
set together. Bingley Jane, however, soon allowed others
outstrip them. They lagged behind, Elizabeth, Kitty, Darcy
entertain other. Very little said either; Kitty
much afraid talk; Elizabeth secretly forming
desperate resolution; perhaps might same.

They walked towards Lucases, Kitty wished call upon
Maria; Elizabeth saw occasion making general concern,
Kitty left went boldly alone. Now
moment resolution executed, and, courage
high, immediately said:

"Mr. Darcy, I selfish creature; and, sake giving
relief feelings, care much I may wounding yours. I
longer help thanking unexampled kindness
poor sister. Ever since I known it, I anxious
acknowledge gratefully I feel it. Were known rest
family, I merely gratitude express."

"I sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, tone surprise
emotion, "that ever informed may,
mistaken light, given uneasiness. I think Mrs. Gardiner
little trusted."

"You must blame aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed
concerned matter; and, course, I could
rest till I knew particulars. Let thank again,
name family, generous compassion induced
take much trouble, bear many mortifications,
sake discovering them."

"If _will_ thank me," replied, "let alone.
That wish giving happiness might add force
inducements led on, I shall attempt deny. But
_family_ owe nothing. Much I respect them, I believe I thought
_you_."

Elizabeth much embarrassed say word. After short pause,
companion added, "You generous trifle me. If
feelings still last April, tell once. _My_
affections wishes unchanged, one word silence
subject ever."

Elizabeth, feeling common awkwardness anxiety
situation, forced speak; immediately, though
fluently, gave understand sentiments undergone
material change, since period alluded, make
receive gratitude pleasure present assurances. The
happiness reply produced, probably never
felt before; expressed occasion sensibly
warmly man violently love supposed do. Had Elizabeth
able encounter eye, might seen well
expression heartfelt delight, diffused face, became him;
but, though could look, could listen, told
feelings, which, proving importance him, made
affection every moment valuable.

They walked on, without knowing direction. There much
thought, felt, said, attention objects. She
soon learnt indebted present good understanding
efforts aunt, call return
London, relate journey Longbourn, motive,
substance conversation Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically
every expression latter which, ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted perverseness assurance; belief
relation must assist endeavours obtain promise
nephew refused give. But, unluckily
ladyship, effect exactly contrariwise.

"It taught hope," said he, "as I scarcely ever allowed
hope before. I knew enough disposition certain that,
absolutely, irrevocably decided me, would
acknowledged Lady Catherine, frankly openly."

Elizabeth coloured laughed replied, "Yes, know enough
frankness believe capable _that_. After abusing
abominably face, I could scruple abusing
relations."

"What say me, I deserve? For, though
accusations ill-founded, formed mistaken premises,
behaviour time merited severest reproof. It
unpardonable. I cannot think without abhorrence."

"We quarrel greater share blame annexed
evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct neither, strictly examined,
irreproachable; since then, both, I hope, improved
civility."

"I cannot easily reconciled myself. The recollection I
said, conduct, manners, expressions whole
it, now, many months, inexpressibly painful me. Your
reproof, well applied, I shall never forget: 'had behaved
gentlemanlike manner.' Those words. You know not,
scarcely conceive, tortured me;--though time,
I confess, I reasonable enough allow justice."

"I certainly far expecting make strong
impression. I smallest idea ever felt
way."

"I easily believe it. You thought devoid every proper
feeling, I sure did. The turn countenance I shall never
forget, said I could addressed possible
way would induce accept me."

"Oh! repeat I said. These recollections
all. I assure I long heartily ashamed it."

Darcy mentioned letter. "Did it," said he, "did soon make
think better me? Did you, reading it, give credit
contents?"

She explained effect been, gradually
former prejudices removed.

"I knew," said he, "that I wrote must give pain,
necessary. I hope destroyed letter. There one part
especially, opening it, I dread
power reading again. I remember expressions might
justly make hate me."

"The letter shall certainly burnt, believe essential
preservation regard; but, though reason think
opinions entirely unalterable, not, I hope, quite easily
changed implies."

"When I wrote letter," replied Darcy, "I believed perfectly
calm cool, I since convinced written
dreadful bitterness spirit."

"The letter, perhaps, began bitterness, end so. The
adieu charity itself. But think letter. The feelings
person wrote, person received it,
widely different then, every unpleasant
circumstance attending ought forgotten. You must learn
philosophy. Think past remembrance gives
pleasure."

"I cannot give credit philosophy kind. Your
retrospections must totally void reproach, contentment
arising philosophy, but, much better,
innocence. But me, so. Painful recollections intrude
cannot, ought not, repelled. I selfish
life, practice, though principle. As child I
taught right, I taught correct temper. I
given good principles, left follow pride conceit.
Unfortunately son (for many years child), I spoilt
parents, who, though good (my father, particularly,
benevolent amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught
selfish overbearing; care none beyond family
circle; think meanly rest world; wish least
think meanly sense worth compared own. Such I
was, eight eight twenty; I might still
you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What I owe you! You
taught lesson, hard indeed first, advantageous. By you,
I properly humbled. I came without doubt reception.
You showed insufficient pretensions please woman
worthy pleased."

"Had persuaded I should?"

"Indeed I had. What think vanity? I believed
wishing, expecting addresses."

"My manners must fault, intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant deceive you, spirits might often lead
wrong. How must hated _that_ evening?"

"Hate you! I angry perhaps first, anger soon began take
proper direction."

"I almost afraid asking thought me, met
Pemberley. You blamed coming?"

"No indeed; I felt nothing surprise."

"Your surprise could greater _mine_ noticed you.
My conscience told I deserved extraordinary politeness, I
confess I expect receive _more_ due."

"My object then," replied Darcy, "was show you, every civility
power, I mean resent past; I hoped
obtain forgiveness, lessen ill opinion, letting
see reproofs attended to. How soon wishes
introduced I hardly tell, I believe half
hour I seen you."

He told Georgiana's delight acquaintance,
disappointment sudden interruption; naturally leading
cause interruption, soon learnt resolution
following Derbyshire quest sister formed
quitted inn, gravity thoughtfulness
arisen struggles purpose must
comprehend.

She expressed gratitude again, painful subject
each, dwelt farther.

After walking several miles leisurely manner, busy know
anything it, found last, examining watches,
time home.

"What could become Mr. Bingley Jane!" wonder
introduced discussion affairs. Darcy delighted
engagement; friend given earliest information
it.

"I must ask whether surprised?" said Elizabeth.

"Not all. When I went away, I felt would soon happen."

"That say, given permission. I guessed much." And
though exclaimed term, found pretty much
case.

"On evening going London," said he, "I made
confession him, I believe I ought made long ago. I
told occurred make former interference
affairs absurd impertinent. His surprise great. He never
slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, I believed
mistaken supposing, I done, sister indifferent
him; I could easily perceive attachment
unabated, I felt doubt happiness together."

Elizabeth could help smiling easy manner directing
friend.

"Did speak observation," said she, "when told
sister loved him, merely information last spring?"

"From former. I narrowly observed two visits
I lately made here; I convinced affection."

"And assurance it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction
him."

"It did. Bingley unaffectedly modest. His diffidence
prevented depending judgment anxious case,
reliance mine made every thing easy. I obliged confess
one thing, time, unjustly, offended him. I could
allow conceal sister town three months
last winter, I known it, purposely kept him. He
angry. But anger, I persuaded, lasted longer remained
doubt sister's sentiments. He heartily forgiven
now."

Elizabeth longed observe Mr. Bingley delightful
friend; easily guided worth invaluable; checked
herself. She remembered yet learn laughed at,
rather early begin. In anticipating happiness
Bingley, course inferior own,
continued conversation till reached house. In hall
parted.



Chapter 59


"My dear Lizzy, walking to?" question
Elizabeth received Jane soon entered room,
others sat table. She
say reply, wandered about, till beyond
knowledge. She coloured spoke; neither that, anything
else, awakened suspicion truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked laughed, unacknowledged silent.
Darcy disposition happiness overflows mirth;
Elizabeth, agitated confused, rather _knew_ happy
_felt_ so; for, besides immediate embarrassment,
evils her. She anticipated would felt
family situation became known; aware
one liked Jane; even feared others
dislike fortune consequence might away.

At night opened heart Jane. Though suspicion far
Miss Bennet's general habits, absolutely incredulous here.

"You joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged Mr. Darcy! No, no,
shall deceive me. I know impossible."

"This wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence you;
I sure nobody else believe me, not. Yet, indeed, I
earnest. I speak nothing truth. He still loves me,
engaged."

Jane looked doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! cannot be. I know much
dislike him."

"You know nothing matter. _That_ forgot. Perhaps I
always love well I now. But cases
these, good memory unpardonable. This last time I shall ever
remember myself."

Miss Bennet still looked amazement. Elizabeth again,
seriously assured truth.

"Good Heaven! really so! Yet I must believe you," cried
Jane. "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I congratulate you--but
certain? forgive question--are quite certain
happy him?"

"There doubt that. It settled us already,
happiest couple world. But pleased,
Jane? Shall like brother?"

"Very, much. Nothing could give either Bingley
delight. But considered it, talked impossible. And
really love quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! anything rather
marry without affection. Are quite sure feel ought
do?"

"Oh, yes! You think I feel _more_ I ought do, I
tell all."

"What mean?"

"Why, I must confess I love better I Bingley. I
afraid angry."

"My dearest sister, _be_ serious. I want talk seriously. Let
know every thing I know, without delay. Will tell
long loved him?"

"It coming gradually, I hardly know began.
But I believe I must date first seeing beautiful grounds
Pemberley."

Another entreaty would serious, however, produced
desired effect; soon satisfied Jane solemn assurances
attachment. When convinced article, Miss Bennet nothing
wish.

"Now I quite happy," said she, "for happy myself.
I always value him. Were nothing love you,
I must always esteemed him; now, Bingley's friend
husband, Bingley dear me. But
Lizzy, sly, reserved me. How little
tell passed Pemberley Lambton! I owe I know
another, you."

Elizabeth told motives secrecy. She unwilling
mention Bingley; unsettled state feelings made
equally avoid name friend. But would longer
conceal share Lydia's marriage. All acknowledged,
half night spent conversation.

* * * * *

"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, stood window next
morning, "if disagreeable Mr. Darcy coming
dear Bingley! What mean tiresome always
coming here? I notion would go a-shooting, something
other, disturb us company. What shall him?
Lizzy, must walk again, may Bingley's
way."

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing convenient proposal; yet
really vexed mother always giving
epithet.

As soon entered, Bingley looked expressively,
shook hands warmth, left doubt good information;
soon afterwards said aloud, "Mrs. Bennet, lanes
hereabouts Lizzy may lose way to-day?"

"I advise Mr. Darcy, Lizzy, Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, "to walk
Oakham Mount morning. It nice long walk, Mr. Darcy
never seen view."

"It may well others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I
sure much Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?" Kitty owned
rather stay home. Darcy professed great curiosity see
view Mount, Elizabeth silently consented. As went
stairs get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:

"I quite sorry, Lizzy, forced
disagreeable man yourself. But I hope mind it:
Jane's sake, know; occasion talking
him, except then. So, put
inconvenience."

During walk, resolved Mr. Bennet's consent
asked course evening. Elizabeth reserved
application mother's. She could determine mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether wealth grandeur
would enough overcome abhorrence man. But whether
violently set match, violently delighted it,
certain manner would equally ill adapted credit
sense; could bear Mr. Darcy hear
first raptures joy, first vehemence
disapprobation.

* * * * *

In evening, soon Mr. Bennet withdrew library, saw
Mr. Darcy rise also follow him, agitation seeing
extreme. She fear father's opposition, going
made unhappy; means--that _she_,
favourite child, distressing choice,
filling fears regrets disposing her--was wretched
reflection, sat misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking him, little relieved smile. In minutes
approached table sitting Kitty; and,
pretending admire work said whisper, "Go father,
wants library." She gone directly.

Her father walking room, looking grave anxious.
"Lizzy," said he, "what doing? Are senses,
accepting man? Have always hated him?"

How earnestly wish former opinions
reasonable, expressions moderate! It would spared
explanations professions exceedingly awkward give;
necessary, assured him, confusion,
attachment Mr. Darcy.

"Or, words, determined him. He rich,
sure, may fine clothes fine carriages Jane.
But make happy?"

"Have objection," said Elizabeth, "than belief
indifference?"

"None all. We know proud, unpleasant sort man;
would nothing really liked him."

"I do, I like him," replied, tears eyes, "I love him.
Indeed improper pride. He perfectly amiable. You
know really is; pray pain speaking
terms."

"Lizzy," said father, "I given consent. He kind
man, indeed, I never dare refuse anything,
condescended ask. I give _you_, resolved
him. But let advise think better it. I know
disposition, Lizzy. I know could neither happy
respectable, unless truly esteemed husband; unless looked
superior. Your lively talents would place
greatest danger unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit misery. My child, let grief seeing
_you_ unable respect partner life. You know
about."

Elizabeth, still affected, earnest solemn reply;
length, repeated assurances Mr. Darcy really object
choice, explaining gradual change estimation
undergone, relating absolute certainty affection
work day, stood test many months'
suspense, enumerating energy good qualities,
conquer father's incredulity, reconcile match.

"Well, dear," said he, ceased speaking, "I
say. If case, deserves you. I could parted
you, Lizzy, anyone less worthy."

To complete favourable impression, told Mr. Darcy
voluntarily done Lydia. He heard astonishment.

"This evening wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy every thing;
made match, gave money, paid fellow's debts, got
commission! So much better. It save world trouble
economy. Had uncle's doing, I must _would_
paid him; violent young lovers carry every thing
way. I shall offer pay to-morrow; rant storm
love you, end matter."

He recollected embarrassment days before, reading
Mr. Collins's letter; laughing time, allowed
last go--saying, quitted room, "If young men come
Mary Kitty, send in, I quite leisure."

Elizabeth's mind relieved heavy weight; and,
half hour's quiet reflection room, able join
others tolerable composure. Every thing recent
gaiety, evening passed tranquilly away; longer
anything material dreaded, comfort ease familiarity
would come time.

When mother went dressing-room night, followed her,
made important communication. Its effect extraordinary;
first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, unable
utter syllable. Nor many, many minutes could
comprehend heard; though general backward credit
advantage family, came shape
lover them. She began length recover, fidget
chair, get up, sit again, wonder, bless herself.

"Good gracious! Lord bless me! think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
thought it! And really true? Oh! sweetest Lizzy! rich
great be! What pin-money, jewels, carriages
have! Jane's nothing it--nothing all. I
pleased--so happy. Such charming man!--so handsome! tall!--Oh,
dear Lizzy! pray apologise disliked much before. I
hope overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house town! Every thing
charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand year! Oh,
Lord! What become me. I shall go distracted."

This enough prove approbation need doubted:
Elizabeth, rejoicing effusion heard herself,
soon went away. But three minutes room,
mother followed her.

"My dearest child," cried, "I think nothing else! Ten
thousand year, likely more! 'Tis good Lord! And
special licence. You must shall married special licence. But
dearest love, tell dish Mr. Darcy particularly fond of,
I may to-morrow."

This sad omen mother's behaviour gentleman
might be; Elizabeth found that, though certain
possession warmest affection, secure relations'
consent, still something wished for. But morrow
passed much better expected; Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
awe intended son-in-law ventured speak
him, unless power offer attention, mark
deference opinion.

Elizabeth satisfaction seeing father taking pains get
acquainted him; Mr. Bennet soon assured rising
every hour esteem.

"I admire three sons-in-law highly," said he. "Wickham, perhaps,
favourite; I think I shall like _your_ husband quite well
Jane's."



Chapter 60


Elizabeth's spirits soon rising playfulness again, wanted Mr.
Darcy account ever fallen love her. "How could
begin?" said she. "I comprehend going charmingly,
made beginning; could set first
place?"

"I cannot fix hour, spot, look, words,
laid foundation. It long ago. I middle I
knew I _had_ begun."

"My beauty early withstood, manners--my behaviour
_you_ least always bordering uncivil, I never spoke
without rather wishing give pain not. Now sincere;
admire impertinence?"

"For liveliness mind, I did."

"You may well call impertinence once. It little less.
The fact is, sick civility, deference, officious
attention. You disgusted women always speaking,
looking, thinking _your_ approbation alone. I roused,
interested you, I unlike _them_. Had really
amiable, would hated it; spite pains
took disguise yourself, feelings always noble just;
heart, thoroughly despised persons assiduously
courted you. There--I saved trouble accounting
it; really, things considered, I begin think perfectly
reasonable. To sure, knew actual good me--but nobody thinks
_that_ fall love."

"Was good affectionate behaviour Jane
ill Netherfield?"

"Dearest Jane! could done less her? But make virtue
means. My good qualities protection,
exaggerate much possible; and, return, belongs
find occasions teasing quarrelling often may
be; I shall begin directly asking made unwilling
come point last. What made shy me, first
called, afterwards dined here? Why, especially, called,
look care me?"

"Because grave silent, gave encouragement."

"But I embarrassed."

"And I."

"You might talked came dinner."

"A man felt less, might."

"How unlucky reasonable answer give,
I reasonable admit it! But I wonder long
_would_ gone on, left yourself. I wonder
_would_ spoken, I asked you! My resolution
thanking kindness Lydia certainly great effect.
_Too much_, I afraid; becomes moral, comfort
springs breach promise? I ought mentioned
subject. This never do."

"You need distress yourself. The moral perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours separate us means
removing doubts. I indebted present happiness
eager desire expressing gratitude. I humour
wait opening yours. My aunt's intelligence given
hope, I determined know every thing."

"Lady Catherine infinite use, ought make happy,
loves use. But tell me, come
Netherfield for? Was merely ride Longbourn embarrassed?
intended serious consequence?"

"My real purpose see _you_, judge, I could, whether I
might ever hope make love me. My avowed one, I avowed
myself, see whether sister still partial Bingley,
were, make confession I since made."

"Shall ever courage announce Lady Catherine
befall her?"

"I likely want time courage, Elizabeth. But
ought done, give sheet paper, shall
done directly."

"And I letter write myself, I might sit
admire evenness writing, another young lady did. But
I aunt, too, must longer neglected."

From unwillingness confess much intimacy Mr. Darcy
over-rated, Elizabeth never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's
long letter; now, _that_ communicate knew would
welcome, almost ashamed find uncle
aunt already lost three days happiness, immediately wrote
follows:

"I would thanked before, dear aunt, I ought done,
long, kind, satisfactory, detail particulars; say
truth, I cross write. You supposed really existed.
But _now_ suppose much choose; give loose rein
fancy, indulge imagination every possible flight
subject afford, unless believe actually married,
cannot greatly err. You must write soon, praise
great deal last. I thank you, again,
going Lakes. How could I silly wish it! Your
idea ponies delightful. We go round Park every day. I
happiest creature world. Perhaps people said
before, one justice. I happier even Jane;
smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends love world
spare me. You come Pemberley Christmas.
Yours, etc."

Mr. Darcy's letter Lady Catherine different style; still
different either Mr. Bennet sent Mr. Collins, reply
last.

"DEAR SIR,

"I must trouble congratulations. Elizabeth soon
wife Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine well can.
But, I you, I would stand nephew. He give.

"Yours sincerely, etc."

Miss Bingley's congratulations brother, approaching
marriage, affectionate insincere. She wrote even
Jane occasion, express delight, repeat
former professions regard. Jane deceived,
affected; though feeling reliance her, could help writing
much kinder answer knew deserved.

The joy Miss Darcy expressed receiving similar information,
sincere brother's sending it. Four sides paper
insufficient contain delight, earnest desire
loved sister.

Before answer could arrive Mr. Collins, congratulations
Elizabeth wife, Longbourn family heard
Collinses come Lucas Lodge. The reason
sudden removal soon evident. Lady Catherine rendered
exceedingly angry contents nephew's letter,
Charlotte, really rejoicing match, anxious get away till
storm blown over. At moment, arrival friend
sincere pleasure Elizabeth, though course
meetings must sometimes think pleasure dearly bought,
saw Mr. Darcy exposed parading obsequious civility
husband. He bore it, however, admirable calmness. He could even
listen Sir William Lucas, complimented carrying away
brightest jewel country, expressed hopes
meeting frequently St. James's, decent composure. If
shrug shoulders, till Sir William sight.

Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity another, perhaps greater, tax
forbearance; though Mrs. Phillips, well sister, stood
much awe speak familiarity Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever _did_ speak, must vulgar.
Nor respect him, though made quiet,
likely make elegant. Elizabeth could shield
frequent notice either, ever anxious keep
herself, family might converse
without mortification; though uncomfortable feelings arising
took season courtship much pleasure,
added hope future; looked forward delight
time removed society little pleasing
either, comfort elegance family party
Pemberley.



Chapter 61


Happy maternal feelings day Mrs. Bennet got
rid two deserving daughters. With delighted pride
afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, talked Mrs. Darcy, may
guessed. I wish I could say, sake family,
accomplishment earnest desire establishment many
children produced happy effect make sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman rest life; though perhaps
lucky husband, might relished domestic felicity
unusual form, still occasionally nervous
invariably silly.

Mr. Bennet missed second daughter exceedingly; affection
drew oftener home anything else could do. He delighted
going Pemberley, especially least expected.

Mr. Bingley Jane remained Netherfield twelvemonth. So near
vicinity mother Meryton relations desirable even
_his_ easy temper, _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish
sisters gratified; bought estate neighbouring county
Derbyshire, Jane Elizabeth, addition every source
happiness, within thirty miles other.

Kitty, material advantage, spent chief time
two elder sisters. In society superior generally
known, improvement great. She ungovernable
temper Lydia; and, removed influence Lydia's example,
became, proper attention management, less irritable, less
ignorant, less insipid. From disadvantage Lydia's
society course carefully kept, though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited come stay her, promise
balls young men, father would never consent going.

Mary daughter remained home; necessarily
drawn pursuit accomplishments Mrs. Bennet's quite
unable sit alone. Mary obliged mix world,
could still moralize every morning visit;
longer mortified comparisons sisters' beauty own,
suspected father submitted change without
much reluctance.

As Wickham Lydia, characters suffered revolution
marriage sisters. He bore philosophy conviction
Elizabeth must become acquainted whatever ingratitude
falsehood unknown her; spite every
thing, wholly without hope Darcy might yet prevailed
make fortune. The congratulatory letter Elizabeth received
Lydia marriage, explained that, wife least,
himself, hope cherished. The letter
effect:

"MY DEAR LIZZY,

"I wish joy. If love Mr. Darcy half well I dear
Wickham, must happy. It great comfort
rich, nothing else do, I hope think us.
I sure Wickham would like place court much, I
think shall quite money enough live upon without help.
Any place would do, three four hundred year; however,
speak Mr. Darcy it, rather not.

"Yours, etc."

As happened Elizabeth _much_ rather not, endeavoured
answer put end every entreaty expectation kind.
Such relief, however, power afford, practice
might called economy private expences,
frequently sent them. It always evident
income theirs, direction two persons extravagant
wants, heedless future, must insufficient
support; whenever changed quarters, either Jane
sure applied little assistance
towards discharging bills. Their manner living, even
restoration peace dismissed home, unsettled
extreme. They always moving place place quest cheap
situation, always spending ought. His affection
soon sunk indifference; lasted little longer;
spite youth manners, retained claims
reputation marriage given her.

Though Darcy could never receive _him_ Pemberley, yet,
Elizabeth's sake, assisted profession. Lydia
occasionally visitor there, husband gone enjoy
London Bath; Bingleys frequently
staid long, even Bingley's good humour overcome,
proceeded far talk giving hint gone.

Miss Bingley deeply mortified Darcy's marriage;
thought advisable retain right visiting Pemberley,
dropt resentment; fonder ever Georgiana, almost
attentive Darcy heretofore, paid every arrear civility
Elizabeth.

Pemberley Georgiana's home; attachment sisters
exactly Darcy hoped see. They able love
even well intended. Georgiana highest opinion
world Elizabeth; though first often listened
astonishment bordering alarm lively, sportive, manner
talking brother. He, always inspired respect
almost overcame affection, saw object open
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge never fallen
way. By Elizabeth's instructions, began comprehend
woman may take liberties husband brother
always allow sister ten years younger himself.

Lady Catherine extremely indignant marriage nephew;
gave way genuine frankness character
reply letter announced arrangement, sent
language abusive, especially Elizabeth, time
intercourse end. But length, Elizabeth's persuasion,
prevailed overlook offence, seek reconciliation;
and, little resistance part aunt,
resentment gave way, either affection him, curiosity
see wife conducted herself; condescended wait
Pemberley, spite pollution woods
received, merely presence mistress,
visits uncle aunt city.

With Gardiners, always intimate terms.
Darcy, well Elizabeth, really loved them; ever
sensible warmest gratitude towards persons who, bringing
Derbyshire, means uniting them.
